23,Am I still a vegan if I don‚Äôt think veganism is healthy?,"I went vegan before and got  extremely sick. I found the ex-vegan movement accommodating and understanding of my struggles, and a lot if them still love animals very much. After my recovery I decided to try veganism again, this time adding oysters, mussels, etc to prevent my health from deteriorating as it did the first time. 

My question for the community is, to what extent can I be tolerated by the vegan community if I am 1. Vegan for the animals and 2. Adamantly against the idea that veganism is healthier? 

This is not meant to be a debate about nutrition (I won‚Äôt reply to responses about that), just a question about the vegan community. My goal might be to create a movement of ex-vegans who have decided to go vegan again with the help of nutrients from these ‚Äúplant like animals‚Äù.  I know many vegans eat oysters, so what would be different about us is that we would vociferously oppose the health arguments for veganism. Would we still be welcome in vegan communities/ events/ activism? Are we a separate movement? 

If there is too much passive hostility in the comments then maybe we aren‚Äôt welcome. I am interested to see how this goes.",vegan,loveanimalshatevegan,1577637117,0,True,2019-12-29

57,Dealing with stomach aches since going vegan.,"First off, I'm worried this post is going to come off as concern trolling but it really isn't. The last thing I want is to end up reverting back to a veggie or worse omni diet. If anyone can provide any advice or tips on how to help I would be greatly appreciative. 


I've been vegan for about 3 months now and I've been dealing with a seeming steady increase of stomach aches and fairly severe gas after meals. I have always had a strong stomach so this is a very new and annoying issue for me to deal with. They occur after pretty much any meal with a decent amount of protein. They have been especially bad after I eat any soy proteins or wheat based proteins with mock meats being the worse offenders. Legume allergies run in my family so I'm beginning to wonder if I might have been blessed with such an affection. I've tried to eat more wheat protein but as stated above, that also makes my stomach hurt. 


I'm not sure what to do other than to buck up and deal with it. Is it normal to have a transitional period of digestive distress while my body adjusts to its new diet?",vegan,dudeeveryoneishot,1577648040,7,True,2019-12-29

65,"no CLUE where to start, like at ALL. not even a vague idea","okay, so i'm 17, in my last year of high school and i've been vegetarian for around only five months. i haven't missed the meat itself, but i've been avoiding going full vegan simply because in my current situation it was incredibly inconvenient. i planned on trying veganuary, and it worked out well because i just got back from an 8-day cruise with almost no vegan options. now that that's over, i feel that i want to commit for a month, but i've got no idea where to start. i can't cook, i don't even have a rudimentary knowledge of vitamins and food groups, and i have school with homework and work some days during the week and on weekends. i already only drink almond milk when i can, so that won't be too hard, and when i pressed for time i have those fake Boca ""chicken"" patties for protein.

i was just wondering what kind of things are really super easy to make, that don't take long and that i can meal prep with or something?

and additionally, another problem i have is talking to servers about dietary restrictions. like on that aforementioned cruise i was on, they had vegan and vegetarian menus, but i was so determined to not make a fuss and couldn't bring myself to ask for them. i ended up always picking the one, sub-par, accidentally vegetarian option from the regular menu and dealing with that. i just really don't like to be inconvenient at restaurants or anywhere else, and even thinking about doing that while dining with other people and having to have a whole conversation about being vegan makes me sweat. just don't want to be one of those ""sorry, i can't have anything on this menu, ahem, i'm a vegan"" people that get made fun of. how did you get past that roadblock?",vegan,sarahhmitchell,1577651161,13,True,2019-12-29

73,A Weird Lunch,"Went out with my omnivore friends yesterday. My girlfriend C chose a vegan restaurant for us all to try. The food was sub-par, but hey, we all tried it. I was touched they chose this place mainly for me. My friend C and her bf R are bragging that every Sunday they go to farmer's market and get amazing vegan food there, and they eat vegan meals a couple times a week, it's so healthy, and yada yada.   
After lunch, we all take a walk a few blocks in the downtown area, we are sight seeing a bit, just having a good time, we make it to this other restaurant, an omnivore one, because I guess they all wanted to try the cocktails there. So we go in for a cocktail. We all sit down. Two of my friends (C and R) proceed to order the grass-fed beef burger. They are telling me, ""This place only has organic, local beef, it's not like that cruel factory farmed stuff, this is great."" I really don't know what to say to that, so I just smile. I order a cocktail, so does my other guy friend J. But, I'm sitting there, watching them eat these giant beef burgers just 2 hours after they ate vegan food with me. It was the weirdest moment. My heart just kind of sank. I kind of wish we had just all gone to an omnivore restaurant in the first place. At least, I wish they'd stop trying to say things to me they think I want to hear. It's made our friendship weird. I'm still processing this. I'm new to veganism, only 10 months in, but their comments are so bizarre to me.",vegan,bodhitreefrog,1577654627,3,True,2019-12-29

122,Very torn about a car with a leather steering wheel,"So, this has been causing my girlfriend and me some significant distress. We're both vegan, and we've pretty much eliminated all non-vegan products from our lives. I do a lot of work to ensure every purchase I make is animal-product free. 

At this point in our lives, we need to lease a car. We had hoped to get a Tesla for the environmental benefit and the leather-free interior, but we just can't swing it financially. We've been spending hours looking for a car that doesn't have any leather and have even started planning out a website with our findings to help others. Although we've found some options, we can't find any that fit our needs on a safety level because of our specific situation (we're moving to a rural area in the mountains where there's lots of snow). We were all set to get a RAV4 because it *basically* has the safety features we want, but it performs significantly worse in the snow, and it has a significantly worse crash test rating. 

I'm honestly kind of at a loss right now. Leasing a car with a leather-wrapped steering wheel feels terribly wrong to me, but I also feel like I need to be practical and put my and my girlfriend's safety first. Driving a car is probably the most dangerous thing we do, and every little bit of safety counts. We've thought about getting a second-hand, but we can't afford that.

2 teaspoons white wine vinegar
4 teaspoons  red miso paste

1  stalk of scallion, finely sliced
1 pinch  salt
1 pinch  black pepper

I kept the instructions basically the same as in the recipe except I pan-roasted the brussel sprouts after cutting them in half for about 7 minutes, then added the mushrooms and cooked for another 5.

I don't know what has happened this past year but I just can't face fake meat. I push them to one side in my meals and now starting to order veg only meals even if there is a faux meat option.

This is not because it represents animals, it's because my body physically doesn't seem to want it. I take a bite no matter how hungry I am, it makes me feel nauseous. 

I don't know if it is what they are made with or what, I've tried different brands, still no luck. It's annoying as I now am struggling to think of meal ideas as I am not a fan of lentils/bean burgers or any mashed veg in the shape of a sausage. I really want to enjoy it again but dont get why my body just doesn't seem to want it. Any ideas why this may be, or anyone else feeling the same?

246,Advice on being told to give my baby cow‚Äôs milk.,"I‚Äôm not sure what I should do. I receive WIC for my almost 10 month old, and just had an appointment with them. They told me starting at 11 months, I will start slowly introducing him to whole milk. I.e, make a 6oz bottle of formula (I unfortunately had to stop breastfeeding a couple months ago due to needing to work a ton of overtime daily so wic gives him similac) and 2oz of whole milk. I mentioned to her that I received plant based milk from them while I was pregnant, and wanted to give him the same. She said it is vital he is given whole milk as the fat helps with his brain development. If he is allergic or cannot tolerate dairy milk, he‚Äôd need a doctor note but would instead be given lactose free milk or soy milk depending on the situation.

Frankly, I can‚Äôt justify giving him this milk and although I am grateful for the help, I also feel bad for wasting anything. I remember while I was pregnant they gave me eggs and I ended up giving them to my FIL. Should I do the same or something similar once I‚Äôm provided milk? I don‚Äôt know if wic actually does give him milk or if she meant I had to buy it.
Also, what would be a vegan alternative to feed him for ‚Äúbrain development‚Äù? I was kind of expecting to feed him whole food plant based meals and I know he can get all of the nutrients by plants but I‚Äôm assuming he may need to focus on a specific nutrient for his brain development? Wouldn‚Äôt that be omega 3s anyway? Or calcium? I feel kind of lost. I haven‚Äôt even told his pediatrician yet, I plan to once we see him on his 1 year appointment but I don‚Äôt feel like I would get much support after hearing from wic.

289,"A Debate: on responsibility and vanity, on self-denial and health","Been on and off vegan for just about a year now and I gotta say I got mixed feelings about it.

&amp;#x200B;

It was mainly an environmental thing at first, and ethical, the two tied together, as a general boycott on the cornfed monoculture hellscape of the middle of the country. I grew up in a place where happy cows roam open hillsides grazing on fresh grass, and chickens eat grasshoppers, and all of it tastes great and wholesome and ain't too too expensive neither. But enough about myself, cutting out red meat at first and weaning myself off all the other fixings I certainly felt a lot lighter, and in a kindofa yogic perspective a little more centered, a little more whole. Here's the fliparound though is I'm dog-tired all the time, skinny down to my damn bones, you know if you've ever seen one of those old penitant monks who deny themselves the world, it's a bit of a picture like that. And so if the proverbial person goes pointing saying, ""But look at all these healthy vegans; you can totally build a good physique with hard work and hemp protein,"" you know paradoxically I'm left wondering where in the hell it would come from within myself, and then I'm lookin at myself feeling ashamed at the same time for eating meat, and for being this all skin and bone. Because dig on this, there was a time I got locked inside my own father's bathroom, and I didn't have the strength to kick that goddamn door down and be free; I was lucky enough to find a bar to pry two of the wooden beams apart. But in the unluckier version of things, no number of yogic mantras, Tarantino flashbacks, or, I'm laughing, amphetamines, is going to substitute for the minimum force of sheer brawn needed to kick down a door that you've become trapped behind.

And the crux of it all hinges around: what's a fool to do? Any damn thing he choose.

It‚Äôs speculated that we evolved because we Did eat animals. Otherwise we‚Äôd still be up in the trees and we wouldn‚Äôt be here sharing our lifestyles with strangers on the Internet. I‚Äôm a vegetarian but I know that animals DO get killed in the clearing of land used to grow our crops. Vegans lie and say that‚Äôs only for grain farms to feed live stock but they Are lying. I‚Äôm a vegetarian but honestly it‚Äôs WAY BETTER FOR THE PLANET if we actually grew our own food. Otherwise you ARE supporting animal death. How many bugs and small animals died to grow our vegetables and fruits? I don‚Äôt know the exact number but if you say none... you‚Äôre lying. If you wanna start growing your own veggies I highly recommend the kratkey method of hydroponics. It uses less water and no electricity is necessary (you can just put it in front of a window). I do recommend getting some LED grow lights, though (you don‚Äôt need fancy ones). And I‚Äôd just like to add that you shouldn‚Äôt just people who hunt for food because guess what... they‚Äôre not relying on factory farms and it‚Äôs not bad for the environment (climate change is a result of a large population which relies on large scale production and agriculture). A good hunter is smart enough to not go after endangered species because they know they‚Äôll be hungry tomorrow and they deserve to eat just as much as anyone else does. Most vegans rely on commercial agriculture which, again, kills animals. Growing your own food, growing what you want and need, will lead to less waste of all our natural resources. So don‚Äôt say you‚Äôre a vegan if you contribute to the death of animals by what you put in your mouth! Genuine veganism is much deeper and more difficult than vegans lead on. Just know that everyone with an agenda has just that, an agenda. Our planet is not designed to hold billions of people who constantly need to consume on such a large, greedy scale. Honestly, if you wanna save the planet, the best way to do it is for humans to come together and not make any babies even just for a year, until we can solve some of these very pressing issues which threaten all those babies futures anyway.

The argument is that letting the meat go to waste is unethical. The animal is not harmed intentionally and the meat does not go to waste. The flip side was that respect for the animal should be considered regardless.

339,Vegan Pregnancy - bad teeth,"I've been vegan for a few years, and recently had a baby boy. He's 10 months old now, and has yellow patches on the 4 teeth that have come through. 

It actually looks like a section of the enamel itself is missing. I'll be taking him to the dentist next week, but from what I've researched on the internet I'm pretty sure it's a condition called enamel hypoplasia. 

I've been down a rabbit-hole researching this, and it's lead me to vitamin K2. It's important for teeth development, and although the body can convert some K1 (found in veggies) to K2 (found in animal products), it seems like scientists are starting to doubt the efficiency of that. The research seems pretty new - K2 was only discovered in 2007 or something. 

I was diligent in planning all the usual nutritients you hear about - B12, D, calcium, etc. Buy I just hadn't heard or thought about K2.

Has anyone else experienced this? I have found other similar stories elsewhere but I don't know how representative it is. Or, anyone who was vegan throughout pregnancy whose kids have great teeth?

341,My Vitamin &amp; Mineral Supplements research during vegan pregnancy,"My girlfriend and I are expecting a baby in February. Once I found out we were pregnant one of the first things I did was spend a night researching which vitamins and nutrients are important to make sure she and the baby have enough of these.
Generally we eat very healthy, almost completely organic, but still it is hard to get things such as B12 or Omega Acids from plants only, so wanted to be on the safe side and supplement to the daily minimum dose.
Below is a list of what my midnight hours on the internet returned in condensed form. 
In short my GF and our baby are doing great, and the doctor that is accompanying us during the pregnancy has stated that everything important is covered. Many people told me I should post this information somewhere so here it is.
If it is of interest I can link two three shops in Germany where vegan supplements are available, for example vegan Omega 3 capsules which was tough to find. (We tried oils first but didn't like the aftertaste) Just let me know...  (I have no affiliation with any shops whatsoever and am in no way being paid or receiving discounts etc. for this.)

Thought it might help others get started. I am NOT a health professional so please confirm this with your doctor and consider this basic information to start with only.


Phatty Acids
-  Omega 3 Acids from EPA and DHA saturated oils or capsules (200 mgDHA/day, essential for mother and child) 

Vitamins
- Vitamin B12 (10-50 ug per day)
- Vitamin B6 
- Vitamin B2 
- Folic acid (400 ug per day, ideally also before pregnancy)
- Vitamin A
- Vitamin C
- Vitamin D3 (20 ug/800ie per day) 

Minerals
- Iron
- Iodine (100-150 ug per day)
- Zink
- Magnesium
- Calcium

We've been taking Chlorella Tablets (B Vitamins) and and Marine Calcium tablets as they include a lot of trace minerals on top. 

The source of the recommended minimum doses etc. was the German PETA site which was a great starting point for us: https://www.peta.de/gesundemama

350,I‚Äôm slipping,"Hi y‚Äôall, just here for some encouragement.  I started eating Vegan around June of this year, and as of recently, I‚Äôve been staring at all the food I used to love and just feeling empty inside.  Not like spiritually empty, but physically empty.  I noticed when I first started eating Vegan, I would feel full, but never satiated.  This leads me to eat all day long, but I never feel ‚Äúfull‚Äù even though my stomach feels full. This, mixed with some cravings has caused me to break on just a couple occasions and eat cheese.  Since I‚Äôve gone vegan, these are the things I‚Äôve had that have animal products.  

Two bites of Pizza Hut cheesy crust in October. 

A sliver of smoked salmon in November

Mashed potatoes with butter in them at Thanksgiving.

A full babybel cheese (this is my most egregious, because I thought about eating for a full hour before hand and I was in a very low place.  

A slice of cake at a party.  

And most recently, a slice of cheese pizza with all the cheese peeled off.  


I feel bad, I really do, but my plan is to go 100% in the new year.  I feel like I‚Äôve cut myself too much slack, and each time (except for the babybel) my mishap was brought on by social pressure.  I‚Äôm familiar with the term Freegan, and part of me wonders if that‚Äôs a better choice for me, but I‚Äôm also sort of an all or nothing person, and the thought of hurting a sweet cow any more than I have in my life hurts me.  I guess partially, I needed to get this off my chest, but if anyone has been through something similar to what I‚Äôm going through in the transition period, I would love to hear your stories.  And if anyone has any new and unique foods that fill voids left behind by animal products, I‚Äôm all ears.

*Be strong.* 

*Onion had his head chopped off... we ate him*

&amp;#x200B;

Vicky Hamill's childhood love of animals inspired her move to a smallholding in the wilds of Orkney. Initially she had some chickens and a goat but, unable to refuse any animal that needed her help, she quickly found herself tending a motley collection of sheep, cows, goats and geese on her small 'humane' farm.

But farm animals have a defined life cycle. In this memoir, Vicky recounts the conflict between her attachment to her animals and the demands of farming. She vividly recalls the joys of feeding newborn lambs and the despair of killing them, joyous and heartbreaking moments that eventually led her to quit the farm and become a vegan.

Exquisitely narrated and deeply moving, this is a book for anyone who questions the morality of the food on their plate. It doesn't preach but it convincingly tells the story of one woman's journey towards awareness.

I I‚Äôve just been lazy switching to vegan as cooking vegan food has (maybe incorrectly) seemed more difficult, and finding options at restaurants seems more difficult. 

I watched  [The Game Changers on Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/watch/81157840) yesterday which was super interesting, it talks about the benefits athletes have seen when going vegan.

It also talks about the inflammatory effects of animal foods, so I‚Äôm keen to see if a vegan diet could help with some knee and shoulder issues I‚Äôve been having.  

The doc mentions how 3 weeks is how long it takes to see some effects, so I (and my girlfriend and a friend) figured Jan 2020 would be a good month to try go fully vegan and see how we feel.

457,Any Vegan Crocheters/Knitters? I have some questions.,"I have been crocheting for almost 17 years. I typically use acrylic yarn, which is vegan, but I don't like the texture. I find acrylic to be inconsistent as far as texture goes, especially since my previous yarn purchases have been Red Heart and the like because money. The best yarn I have ever used was alpaca (not purchased by me, and used before I went vegan), but obviously that is out of the question.

I'm interested in making items that feel more high-end without necessarily being insanely expensive. I'm basically looking to hone my craft more and make better-quality things that are cruelty-free. Sustainability is also a big deal, and acrylic doesn't really check that box. I haven't worked with a ton of different types of fiber because of cost issues. 

So here's my question: what materials do you guys use? I've heard bamboo yarn and hemp yarn are more sustainable, but how are they on cost and texture? Also, where do you get your yarn? I don't think my local craft stores will have that kind of thing so I'm curious as to where I can find more sustainable vegan yarn. I'm willing to pay a little more now that I'm older and have a better-paying job, so I really want to explore my options.

If all goes as planned I will be graduating next semester and am starting an internship at a firm the end of next month, which is a huge opportunity for me since there isn't a lot of options in the area to get experience. I really want this internship to lead to a job offer but it is well known that there are 10 other people to replace me if need be.

Do you avoid foods that have a horrible impact on the environment like palm oil (deforestation of the amazon rainforest and killing of orangutans, I've noticed a lot of vegan food contains palm oil), almonds, soy, etc.? Are you conscious of child and slave labour, as in, do you consume coffee and cocoa that isnt fair trade or buy things made in countries like china, Bangladesh, vietnam etc.? How do you get around? Car, bus, bike? Do you use plastic, including vegan leather, or do you go for plant fiber and other natural biodegradable fibre (plastic of any kind harms the planet which harms animals, for many many years)

His old parents and his family have no idea what veganism is. No matter how many times I answer all their questions. ""You eat cheese, right?"" No. ""You eat eggs, right?"" No. ""You're fine with whipped cream, right?"". NO. I describe veganism very simply: ""I don't eat meat or dairy."" That should cover it. If it is meat from an animal, I don't eat it. If it is made from animal milk, I don't eat it. I can't figure out why that is confusing. I brought my own vegan gravy and a vegan roast, but nothing else, because I was assured repeatedly that I would be able to eat everything else. So, this is what was served: cheese bread, stuffing made with butter, carrots cooked in butter, green beans cooked in butter with bacon, pies made with eggs and butter, and packaged mashed potatoes made with milk and butter. I am not unreasonable, but could we have at least told me that everything would have dairy in it? I would have prepared my own substitutes and not complained. I was in a different house, in a different state, and had to rely only on the food in their home. These are not stupid people. I think that they understand that I don't eat meat, but the whole dairy thing sounds stupid to them so they just used dairy in everything anyway assuming I would just suck it up because it's not a big deal. So, I was super hungry. I ate the one banana I had. I would never be this non accommodating to a guest I had invited on purpose. Can you imagine say you invite a Muslim over for Christmas and you make a ham and put bacon on everything? Same idea. They made hand-whipped heavy whip cream and were ""shocked"" that I didn't want any on my pie made with butter. And, this is an extra, even if I wasn't vegan, I would never cook with that much butter. Butter and cream and cheese in everything. Why not use olive oil, or canola oil, or margarine, like normal healthy people? You guys I was miserable. I brought some instant oatmeal packs with me and snuck into the kitchen in the middle of the night to make some. I was embarrassed and was hoping no one would wake up and find me, because anytime you do anything as a vegan, non-vegans have to comment on it, ask you to explain it, or somehow point out how weird it is.

I wasn't about to lecture or attempt to persuade her in that context, so I purchased the item. I'm reflecting now, to what degree that was wrong.

In re-watching portions of *Earthlings* (or *Dominion)*, I just can't look at a purchase like that innocently.

We've discussed veganism openly. She was very sympathetic to the ethical arguments, and admitted to trying to adopt a vegan diet, but gave up because she disliked the mac &amp; cheese substitutes.

I doubt she would seek out a film like *Earthlings* on her own and it's hard to think of an appropriate moment to suggest a viewing. The violence in that film is difficult and I wouldn't want to add unnecessary stress to her life. That said, I do think the film concludes with quite a positive, compassionate message and its worth engaging with.

I'm curious to what degree this community has dealt or engaged with similar situations / relationships?

I don't think I can purchase any non-vegan items for friends / loved ones from now on. And I'm thinking, when an apt moment arrives, of asking my S.O. if she would be willing to view *Earthlings* together.",vegan,-valleyofthewind-,1575052445,7,True,2019-11-29

61,"Hey guys - I worked as a Plant-Based Nutritionist, largely with vegan athletes + active people. Here are 6 key things to consider with a plant-based diet to do it as healthily as possible","Hey guys - hope it's okay to share this! Just posted it over at r/veganfitness and it seemed to be received fairly well, so thought it might be useful over here.

With increasing awareness of the potential benefits of going vegan and the popularity of documentaries like Game Changers, there‚Äôs more and more people curious about adopting a plant-based diet - which is great!

That being said, I worked as a Plant-Based Nutritionist for several years, and there‚Äôs one thing that‚Äôs a little disconcerting to me:

A large number of people jump into the lifestyle without really having a plan of action or awareness of some of the potential pitfalls / things to look out for.

So with that in mind, I put together a few ideas and thoughts to consider that will hopefully help people avoid getting into any trouble and to instead do a plant-based diet as healthily as possible!

[**Here‚Äôs a link to the full blog post with pretty pictures if you're interested**](https://www.heromovement.net/blog/going-vegan/)

I‚Äôve also put together some of the main points below.

**I definitely don't claim to have all the answers, but hopefully you'll find some value!**

# Consideration 1: Vegan Doesn't Always = Healthy

It's great that we have more and more access to convenient vegan foods, and there‚Äôs definitely a time and a place for indulgence. But it‚Äôs easy to get caught up with the idea that because something is free from animal products, that it's healthy.

The people I‚Äôve seen thrive on a vegan diet have been ones who‚Äôve adopted a wholefood approach for 80-90% of their diet.

I‚Äôve put together an ‚Äòideal‚Äô food plate that I use with some of my clients (and don't know how to embed), but it's essentially:

* A third to a half non-starchy veg
* A quarter to a third protein source
* The rest split into complex carbs and healthy fats depending on your preference

Your plate doesn't have to look exactly like this, but it‚Äôs not a bad starting point!

# Consideration 2: You‚Äôll Need Some Supplements

If you plan your vegan diet around whole foods, you‚Äôll almost definitely be getting more nutrition than you would on the standard western diet. That being said, going plant-based doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre immune to nutrient deficiencies.

In fact, there are a few crucial vitamins, minerals and fatty acids you may miss out on if you‚Äôre not mindful about food choices and/or supplementation. [This study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5598028/) gives a pretty detailed insight on a vegan diet for athletes, but I‚Äôve done my best to break things down below:

* **Vitamin B12.** It‚Äôs essential for the maintenance of the nervous system and cognitive function, and is naturally found in animal foods. I use a methyl-cobalamin B12 spray to keep my levels topped up.
* **Omega-3.** The short chain omega-3 ALA is found in plant food like algae, hemp, flax and chia. But it‚Äôs the long chain omegas EPA and DHA that are thought to be the most important for [brain function, heart health and controlling inflammation](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Omega3FattyAcids-HealthProfessional/). We can convert ALA to EPA/DHA in the body, but that conversion process isn‚Äôt always that efficient. [One study](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/92/5/1040/4597496) concluded that only 8-20% of AHA is converted to EPA, and 0.5-9% to DHA. More research is needed, but an algal EPA/DHA blend can be a valuable addition to your supplement stack.
* **Vitamin D.** We get most of of our Vitamin D from the interaction between the sun and our skin, but not so much in the winter. Although you typically find more Vitamin D in animal foods, eating a vegan diet doesn‚Äôt seem to increase your chances of a [Vitamin D deficiency](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2677010/). Regardless of dietary choices, Vitamin D status is worth keeping an eye on, and using D3 spray if necessary.
* **Vitamin K2.** A key vitamin found in egg yolks and fatty meat, it‚Äôs involved in blood clotting and the utilisation of Vitamin D. Natto, which is super fermented soybeans, is the only reliable vegan source I can think of, and it isn‚Äôt widely available. So I would opt for a K2 spray.
* **Iodine.** Iodine is important for supporting the thyroid gland. One of the best sources is seaweed like nori, kelp and kombu. You‚Äôll also find it in certain fish, dairy products and eggs. So if you‚Äôre going vegan and cutting these out, it‚Äôs definitely worth upping your seaweed intake or opting for an iodine supplement.
* **Vitamin A.** We can get a fair amount of beta-carotene (a precursor to Vitamin A) from plant foods like sweet potatoes and carrots. But like the conversion of AHA to DHA/EPA, beta-carotene to Vitamin A isn‚Äôt necessarily always that efficient ([ranging from 3.8:1 to 28:1 by weight](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/96/5/1193S/4577160) in plant foods). There‚Äôs also the fact that up to [45% of the population](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22113863) may have a gene that makes them ‚Äòlow responders‚Äô to beta carotene ‚Äì so it‚Äôs one to keep an eye on and supplement with if needed.
* **Zinc + Iron.** You‚Äôll find zinc in some plant foods like hemp seeds, lentils and tofu, and iron in leafy greens. But when derived from plant-based sources, [studies suggest](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12030275) the absorption rates are not as efficient. It‚Äôs recommended in the literature that you increase your [zinc intake by 50%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25057538/) and [iron by 80%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12030275) due to reduced bioavailability, however I‚Äôve also seen evidence that suggests your body is able to adapt to lower intakes of both. To be safe, keep an eye on your bloodwork and dietary intake, and supplement if necessary.
* **Calcium.** Moving towards a plant-based diet inevitably means cutting out dairy products. Although this can be beneficial for many reasons, for many people dairy is their main source of calcium. To keep your levels topped up, ensure you‚Äôre consuming plenty of calcium-rich plant foods, including beans, pulses and green veg.

# Consideration #3: Keep An Eye On Your Calories

I experienced a fair bit of unwanted weight loss when I first went vegan, dropping from the mid 70kgs to just under 68kg. For a reference point, I‚Äôm now pushing 90kg‚Ä¶

This is also something I observed with numerous clients who came to me after transitioning to a plant-based diet.

People often don‚Äôt quite realise how calorie-dense animal products can be. Instead of upping our overall volume of food when we go vegan, we simply replace that steak with the same size portion of beans.

**This can lead to a significant calorie deficient, which might sound good if you‚Äôre looking to lose weight, but isn‚Äôt necessarily a great long-term strategy.**

Chronic under-eating can lead to a myriad of hormonal issues, just as overeating has its problems too. So to avoid both, I‚Äôd strongly recommend you bring some awareness to portion sizes if you go plant-based.

Tracking calories isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôm a big fan of, but it can be a useful tool for some in the early stages.

Cronometer is a free app I use from time to time just to check in.

# Consideration #4: Be Mindful Of Protein

It‚Äôs probably the most common question that comes up with a vegan diet:

*Where do you get your protein from?*

We know that protein is important for growth and repair, and muscle protein synthesis is a real consideration if you‚Äôre an athlete or someone who moves a lot.

On the surface, with a little planning ahead it‚Äôs not that difficult to get a similar quantity of protein in grams on a vegan diet as you would on an omnivorous diet ([generally around 1.3-1.8 grams per kg of body weight](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22150425)).

You can use simple hacks like:

* Swapping standard grains (like rice) for pseudo grains (like quinoa)
* Adding seeds to your morning porridge
* Using plenty of nuts and seeds in salads
* Add vegan protein powder to your smoothie

When we dig a little deeper, however, we realise that concentration of certain amino acids [tends to be lower in plant foods](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17908291/) compared to animal products, and that plant-protein may be more difficult [for the body to digest](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21167687/).

**So 100g of plant-protein doesn‚Äôt** ***necessarily*** **result in you absorbing the same quantity of amino acids as 100g of animal protein.**

That isn‚Äôt to say you can‚Äôt get your protein requirements on a plant-based diet.

It just means it may be worth aiming for more total protein than you would on a non-vegan diet (particularly if you‚Äôre active). So if you were consuming around 1.5g/kg of protein prior to going vegan, you might want to up it closer to the 1.8g/kg range.

On top of eating a wide range of beans, lentils, nuts and seeds, you can do this by including a good quality vegan protein powder and/or essential amino acids.

# Consideration #5: Prioritise Digestibility

This is something that doesn‚Äôt get much airtime when we‚Äôre talking about vegan eating or nutrition in general for that matter:

Regardless of the quality of the food you consume, if you can‚Äôt digest it properly, it‚Äôs not doing you any good.

It‚Äôs important to note that on any diet this can become an issue, but I‚Äôve personally seen it magnified on a plant-based one in some cases.

I go into more detail in the article, but the basic ideas are:

* Be mindful of soy and gluten. While you may be fine consuming these moderately, it‚Äôs probably not a great idea to base your diet on them.
* Watch your reaction to lectins + FODMAPS. You may do just fine with them, but if find you‚Äòre getting digestive issues, it might be worth taking a closer look.
* Soak your nuts. And beans and lentils. Soaking them overnight in clean water or going further and sprouting them may reduce the phytic acid content and improve digestibility.
* Go fermental. Fermenting foods can potentially improve digestibility. For example, some people who can‚Äôt tolerate soy in the form of tofu, do just fine with fermented soy as tempeh. You‚Äôll also help support your gut microbiome through the probiotic content.

# Consideration #6: Non-Dietary Factors

Eating healthily isn‚Äôt just about what you do or don‚Äôt eat.

There are numerous other factors that we rarely talk about that are just as valid. These apply to any dietary regime you decide to follow, not just veganism, but they‚Äôre worth mentioning as a reminder:

* Eat slowly and mindfully. Slowing down, chewing thoroughly and eliminating distractions while you eat can improve digestion, prevent overeating, and generally makes mealtimes a more enjoyable experience.
* Don‚Äôt eat stressed. If you‚Äôre eating in a sympathetic, fight-or-flight state, chances are you‚Äôre not going to digest that food properly. Again, slowing down prior to mealtimes is a good shout. If you‚Äôre super stressed, heading out for a short walk or doing some breath work prior to your meals can make a big difference.
* The best diet is the one you can stick to. If you want to adopt a fully plant-based diet but you‚Äôre really struggling to make the change cold-turkey, don‚Äôt sweat it. It doesn‚Äôt have to be all or nothing. I‚Äôm more of a fan of small, steady changes to your habits. It makes the transition period easier, gives your body a better chance to adjust, and allows you to more closely monitor how those small changes impact your body.

# Final Thoughts: Listen to Your Body

People can thrive on a plant-based diet if it's managed well, but we‚Äôd be naive to ignore some of the potential pitfalls!

If we‚Äôre mindful of the above, we stand a much better chance of making it work long-term. But it's also important to listen to your body. Lightly hold the possibility that what works for some might not *always* work for everyone. For me, that‚Äôs a healthier mindset to approach any venture in life.

75,üëãüèΩ newbie here..,"I just started my vegan journey the 17th. I was compelled to look on Reddit for vegan and knew there would be this sub. Then I clicked on the more info and saw the Vegan Challenge and thought, ""Oh, I can do that. 30 days, Pshh."" Welp, I watched Dominion. I couldn't even finish it. I cried... a lot.

I can honestly say I was one of those people with the blinders up walking through life eating meat &amp; poultry due to habit/tradition. I knew these types of documentaries were out there but never went out of my way to go and watch one. I was always too scared to find out the real truth behind this ""food"". I kind of got my SO on board. He's agreed to at least start vegetarian, which I kind of understand. I'm trying to convince him that consuming dairy and eggs is just as bad as eating meat and poultry. He didn't want to watch Dominion and I also understand it wasn't easy for me. We did watch the Game Changers together yesterday (which I think convinced him a little more to go vegan with me). He's so sweet he went to Trader Joe's Wednesday and tried to buy vegan food. It was random shit but I love the fact that he did that for me. It meant a lot. I'm sure if I would've gone with him I would have been equally as lost. üòÖ

Also, I forgot to mention that on Saturday prior to my new journey I had bought groceries. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I wish I would have started sooner. I bought all kinds of meat/cheese filled food. üò© I felt so bad when I told my husband I wouldn't be eating any of it. And even though he's agreed to veg with me he said he'll try to finish all that fridge food so that it doesn't go to waste.

I have already been somewhat dairy free already cuz of my hormonal problems but I never noticed how much food has milk in it. üò£ I stopped buying milk a year ago (used to buy Lactaid) because even though it was lactose free my daughter and I would still end up constipated. We swapped it for Almond milk original (our favorite) and the chocolate Almond milk too which I usually end up mixing with the almond milk cuz it's too much chocolate for her and felt the difference. üòÖ

It's been a little hard for me to figure things out though. A struggle I have is my daughter loves eggs. üò≠ Almost every morning I would make us some before heading out to work. She's 2 years old. She's currently in this stage where she's been super picky. I'll ask her ""Do you want ___?"" And she thinks about it and says, ""Uhh, no."" Almost everytime. She used to try anything we would give her but not anymore. üò£

I take her to the babysitter's (2 days a week), she provides her with snacks and lunch and I do breakfast and dinner. My mom's (2 days) she's not the healthiest 'chef' but she feeds her and she always says she ate ""good"" whatever that means. My MIL (1 day) and she's a vegetarian herself but she has also told me sometimes she won't eat and only asks for eggs. The sitter will also tell me she hasn't eaten and she has to give her a cup of noodles because that's all she'll eat.

She loves her mac and cheese and chicken nuggets. She always wants ""chicken"". I would like to incorporate this lifestyle into her life as well. Some days I make her PB&amp;J half sandwich. She likes those some days and sometimes will have a fit.

Yesterday we did not partake in Thanksgiving. üòå Mostly because we didn't exactly plan anything. My sisters moved away 6 months ago and my brother didn't call me. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è My husband's sister works retail so Black Friday was gonna keep them from coming over(we live an hour away from them). She doesn't drive and depends on her step dad or public transportation to get to work.

Yesterday, my husband made pancakes using a mix, chocolate almond milk and bananas. I had mine with maple syrup and apple slices (I have always had an apple in morning üòä) and some oatmeal with an equal and a little almond milk for flavor. We didn't really have lunch because we had that breakfast a little late (we slept in). And for dinner I made some tacos with smashed beans, sweet potato, cilantro &amp; lettuce. So random but it was so delicious. And I had a breakthrough with my child because she liked it too! Of course I had to sneak in the sweet potatoes and leave the lettuce and cilantro out. But she had no clue the sweet potatoes were there! And later on in the day, we had some naan bread and hummus, which she also loved. üòÆ

Well, I don't know where else I am going with this. I'm excited but also very nervous. I have anxiety that I will cave because it's difficult for me to cook. I know I ùò§ùò¢ùòØ do it. Weekends will be easier but weekdays are something else. I work an hour away from home. I get home at like 7 - 8 pm. Somedays 9 pm depending when I leave work. I am trying to find a job closer to home, I'm tired of the commute but until then that's my life. Most nights I don't have the energy or motivation to come home and cook. If you guys have any suggestions I'm open to hear them.

I am also hoping some of you can offer a simple grocery list to start with because I am getting a little overwhelmed with a lot of the recipes I find. üò¨ I don't really want to rely on frozen vegan meals. I happen to have Thug Kitchen: The Official Cookbook: Eat Like You Give a F*ck. It was my sister's but she left it when she moved out. üòÇ Also, lots of tips and recipes, but again overwhelming.

83,Meat free in Europe (Is it hard? Help?),"*Super sorry about how long this is. If you read it all, thank you. :)*

So...this is a bit far off, but I'm thinking about it now because my grandmother just sent me the itinerary for the trip. I am going to Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Italy for the and a half weeks this Summer with six people: my grandparents, two sisters, and to cousins. They are all omnis.

I am a brand new vegetarian who feels very strongly about not eating meat. I also can see the horrible things in the rest of the animal industry and am switching to vegan beauty and clothing products. I am also planning to try to do my next semester of college completely vegan.

However, my anxiety is sky high about this trip. I am very excited to go and learn about my roots from my grandparents, but my grandma especially just thinks that this is a phase and has already asked me if I would be okay with eating some meat on this trip. My mom talked her down from this by comparing what she asked me to do to her asking a recovering alcoholic to just drink a little alcohol. You wouldn't do that. She stopped pushing me on it after that, but they're not going to try and accommodate me and pick places with options. I have used happy cow and am relieved to see that at least all the major cities we are going to have plenty of vegan options. But I am worried about what to eat at relatives houses and in small towns.

Had anyone navigated something similar to this before? How did you cope and find things to eat without starving or breaking your values. I'm so new at this right now that I'm terrified that I might give in, which I don't want to do.

I'm not upset with my family. They just don't understand how important this is to me and are hoping that it will pass. I want to show them, especially my grandmother, that I can stay meat free and still have a wonderful time.",vegan,MaiaOnReddit,1575063133,2,True,2019-11-29

105,"Does the fact the healing from IBS/SIBO is harder on a vegan diet make it less ""future-proof"" ?","The majority of healing diets are based around meat, fermented dairy etc..

There are many people who just feels better on a carnivore diet cause meat have no fodmaps whereas vegetables,legumes,nuts,fruits do

* (**ARE WE CONFUSED**) Is it about something totally different and our symptoms not necessarily reflect our health? ( meaning that a KETO diet is not necessarily better for you even if it seems that way in the beginning )
* (**Lack** **INTUITION?**) Is it about our inability to differentiate between foods that fuel us vs weaken us because of the variety overload we were fed for years before any imbalance manifested ( individual specific )?

In my eyes meat is just kind of an energy converter that takes the load off of your body therefor making it easier for you to work with, just like lacto fermentation

Next thing I knew, I turned around and the lentil loaf was all but gone and the turkey had hardly been touched! Everyone loved my food  and said I basically saved Thanksgiving for them. :D

The next day one of my friends who was there (an omni) was asking me about how to veganize some of his meals and we had a really good conversation. Somehow the comment of eating dolphins came up (haha I don't remember how) and he said that ought to be illegal! I asked him why dolphin meat in particular should be illegal and he just sat in silence for a few minutes. Then he told me he hated the idea of killing any animal but he loved meat, but he realized then how hypocritical that was. I pointed out to him he is either killing an animal or outsourcing its killing to someone else and he just listened and sat there dumbstruck for a moment.

One thing that has been irritating me, however is a lot of what I perceive to be negative attitudes within the Vegan community, and especially on this subreddit.

The Vegan friends that convinced me gradually to eventually go Vegan are very tolerant and helpful. When I first started this journey, I began by cutting meat out of my diet by small increments, eating less each week. They encouraged me to go at my own pace, happy that I was making progress, and I attribute this to my successful transition away from meat. As I became a Vegetarian I would have slip ups, but my friends chose to be supportive and happy that my intention was to be meat free. 

Several other vegans I have met, however (especially on this subreddit) seem to be so confrontational. I‚Äôve seen so many people in here criticizing others for not being what they consider to be a ‚Äúperfect vegan.‚Äù Examples of this include not entertaining new ideas that would help people transition away from meat, or shutting people down for making mistakes.

There is still a stigma with Veganism in today‚Äôs society, and we‚Äôre not making things better by being judgmental and not supporting things that could help others transition. If our collective goal is to move the world to a Vegan lifestyle, we should be doing what we can to help make the world transition there, instead of  throwing out ideas that might help people transition or judging people who slip up. Otherwise we‚Äôre just feeding into the stereotype of the angry hateful Vegan, and it‚Äôs going to be a lot harder to help move people to this cause.",vegan,perfectlasagna,1575085299,12,True,2019-11-29

my mom, I had been suggesting going vegan due to her having chronic migraines and several prescriptions, shes been vegan 3 years now off all meds.

my boss, he had a doctor scare, his cholesterol is high and bad prostate results. he's always been food conscious even as an omnivore, I recommend a few vegan recipe books and such. hes going vegan for 6 month then going back for another check up, if results are good he's going to stay permanently, but if no changes in his results he said outback steakhouse is his first stop. hes 3 months strong at the moment.

a coworker, he had planned a 3 month long solo trip to india, I told him I also wanted to visit since there are several vegan options out there. upon return he revealed his whole trip he stuck to a vegan diet so that his experience could be more authentic, his voyage continues, it's been about 4 years now.

2 other coworkers.. both of which are similar, gym rats who always gave me their 2 cents on why meat is required to be healthy. they both recently watched the documentary the game changer (I'm yet to see it but hear good things) and suddenly were not so standoffish about my vegan lifestyle. one of which called me at 6am after watching the game changer to inform me he was going vegan, though I am happy for that, he could have chosen a better time to call.

I am an anarchist who is genuinely interested in and appreciative of veganism. I want to be a vegan (and it will be a really hard journey if I choose to do so, as my diet is mostly based on meat and I have only a few vegetables that I like eating, but I think I can overcome this) because of ethical reasons rather than its health benefits, but the argument that eating meat is a part of our nature is making me doubt my plan.

It doesn't have to be a scientific text that proves that humans are actually herbivores (as we clearly have omnivore features from what I know), but just anything that proves that herbivorous diet is sustainable for humans for generations, or only a convincing viewpoint.

I am fully aware of the ethical argument, animals suffer. I absolutely sympathise with them and this fact is indeed a really convincing point for me. I also plan to watch Dominion to be able to visualise this fact more clearly.

I'm not even sure if this belongs here but I figured I'd post it anyway. 

I've been vegan for almost a year now and constantly catch flak about it from my co-workers. I'm not thin-skinned, but I'm just getting tired of the same boring old old jokes and the never-ending army of strawman arguments. 

Anyway, getting back on point! I have a client who must be in his 60s who has been coming to me for a few months. We'd chatted a lot while he's been in and out came up that I'm vegan. He showed an interest and asked a lot about what I eat ect. 

Fast forward to the appointment before last, he sits down in the chair and says:

Client: I'm actually looking for some information,and you're the man to talk to.

I was taken back because I didn't have a clue what he was referring to. It turned out that he and his wife had recently watched the documentary ""Game Changers"" and were in the middle of making their transition into veganism and were looking for places to eat in our city üòÅ

I, of course gave him my own full rundown based off a blog post I wrote months ago about vegan food in my city. I ended up writing down some of my favourite places on a card for him before he left that day. 

He came in again yesterday. Pleased to say he and his wife are making even more progress! He went out after his last appointment and went to one of the restaurants at the top of the list (top of the list was a place that did vegan and Omni dishes, cause their vegan food is banging but the place isn't too intimidating for people getting into it) but they were packed so they ended up going to the fully vegan place instead. 

On top of that he was also telling me about all the documentaries they've been watching including cowspiracy among others. 

He was even talking about how people have started treating him differently because of him going vegan (oddly refreshing to know it's not just me getting shit for itüòÇ).

352,what is the harm in using animal by-products?,"yeah, yeah, yeah throw at me the definition of veganism all you want, but what i'm after is results. Will actions decrease or increase animal suffering? using by-products can make veganism much easier to practice without causing harm to animals (refined sugar is actually not vegan is made from bone char, a by-product of meat industry), I have a co-worker who quit veganism because of all the by products that she couldn't use (refined sugar be the most difficult one. she was also an idiot who said something about veganism was hard because she even got off the bus early to walk so she could lose weight and that she was initially reluctant to quit veganism because she didn't want to break her five year record.)

I want to have discussion about the harm in using animal by products and which ones are ok to use in our current time. For example, i would think that leather wouldnt be okay to use because leather is still an expensive item due to its history and cultural symbol, such that i could see people raising cows just for leather to use for expensive shoes and bags. However, I can also see things like beeswax and gelatin ok to use because their current appeal is that they are cheaper than vegan alternatives, which means that if we use beeswax and gelatin (that are used as part of products instead of the sole ingredient) while abstaining from meat, eggs, and dairy, it would eventually become nonsensical for businesses to use these ingredients because they would no longer be more affordable than vegan alternatives. thoughts?",vegan,LetsEndSuffering,1575195179,15,True,2019-12-01

366,"Despite such a progressive title the book, Soul of an Octopus by Sy Montgomery, doesn't encourage anybody to stop abusing and consuming animals.","I just finished Soul of an Octopus and while it was informative I was not impressed. Early in the book the author talks about eating sushi with her friends from the aqaurium and proudly announces they didnt order the octopus, but they have no issue eating other fish? That is where I fist became skeptical of the book.

Throughout the book she talks about how animals like Eels, sharks, lobsters, etc. feel pain, can sympathize, and have different moods, but she never condemns eating them, and later she quite blatantly defends aquariums' ""need"" to capture these animals in the wild and pull them out of thier natural environment and homes to show off to the public.  She even talks about getting a pet octopus, but only refrains because it would be hard on her husband. (Capturing thriving wild animals for your own amusement should be considered non-vegan right?) 

The books includes other things like forced mating of octopuses, death of captive animals caused by lack of planning but labeled ""unavoidable"", and the people in the book treated animals like paintings in a shitty muesuem to be traded and transported around in small containers (The book unapologetically describes an octopus being mailed in bag of water filled with its own excrament stuffed into an old tv box labeled ""RUSH"", but not labeled delicate or live animal).

369,Convince me.,"I know, the title appears a bit presumptuous. It gives the impression that I just want to argue. I've had plenty of arguments with vegans. I'm not looking for that here. If I wanted to argue, I'd go jump in one of your threads that are already started. I'm really looking for some opposing insight. Now before we get started, let's name the parts that would be a waste of your time trying to convince me. Number 1 by far is empathy/sympathy. I grew up with pets my entire life and at times I respect animals more than humans. But it's a complication between intent and instincts. Humans know what they are doing, animals do not. So animals are more innocent. But I can't grant rights to life to a creature that does not even comprehend the concept of life or death. If you can't comprehend what death is, then you care not for it. Number 2 is the environment. Yes, livestock creates a shitload of farts that fuck up the ozone. But so does your cars, factories, your kids that end up in a job with their name on their shirt breathing our air. Livestock isn't the biggest factor. So do something about the bigger ones before you get up in my diet. I don't want to hear that shit until livestock becomes the top problem. Well, actually that's the only two points I can remember right now that hold any significance at all. I had a list of 5 things in my head but the alcohol kicked in faster than expected. What I do remember is a pleasant vegan I spoke with on youtube who was willing to talk without arguing. We almost came to an agreement, but then they stopped answering. Youtube's fault. Their notification thing is shit. I have to track down old threads sometimes to answer people because even though they tagged my name, youtube didn't notify me that someone responded to me. So, I figure he just didn't get the notification that I responded. But where we ended up is I am willing to give up meat if certain criteria is met. The vegan meat must taste like the real thing. And all B12 and other supplements must be included into food without me having to read labels or keep track of doses. Basically, it needs to be just as convenient and tasty as real meat is. I'm even planning on going to Burger King to try their new veggie burger that they claim tastes like a regular burger. Was supposed to last week, but just my fucking luck that my car busted a hose right before getting there. I pulled into a parking spot and immediately saw steam coming up from my hood. I even said fuck it and went to go inside and figured I might as well eat since I'm there and deal with the car after since it was obviously just a hose and I lived only a couple blocks away. But just my damn luck again, they had a sign on the door that the inside was closed due to being understaffed and only the drive through was open. Well fucking thanks BK. The one thing I just became unable to do and it's the only way I can get that burger. God, you're an asshole sometimes. I was even tempted to push my car into the drive through just cause I'm very fucking determined once I set my mind on something. I wanted that damn burger and I still want to try it now. But all that aside, even if they did succeed at making a veggie burger taste like a real one, they'd be the only one. And it's still fast food. I can't live off BK veggie burgers. And yes, I am so addicted to meat that I'm not giving it up without something to take it's place that tastes just like it. And it would have to have the B12 added. I'm so not doing the pill counting bullshit. I am not, absolutely not, going to take B12 pills when I can just eat tasty meat that already has it.

382,Convince me.," I know, the title appears a bit presumptuous. It gives the impression that I just want to argue. I've had plenty of arguments with vegans. I'm not looking for that here. If I wanted to argue, I'd go jump in one of your threads that are already started. I'm really looking for some opposing insight. Now before we get started, let's name the parts that would be a waste of your time trying to convince me. Number 1 by far is empathy/sympathy. I grew up with pets my entire life and at times I respect animals more than humans. But it's a complication between intent and instincts. Humans know what they are doing, animals do not. So animals are more innocent. But I can't grant rights to life to a creature that does not even comprehend the concept of life or death. If you can't comprehend what death is, then you care not for it. Number 2 is the environment. Yes, livestock creates a shitload of farts that fuck up the ozone. But so does your cars, factories, your kids that end up in a job with their name on their shirt breathing our air. Livestock isn't the biggest factor. So do something about the bigger ones before you get up in my diet. I don't want to hear that shit until livestock becomes the top problem. Well, actually that's the only two points I can remember right now that hold any significance at all. I had a list of 5 things in my head but the alcohol kicked in faster than expected. What I do remember is a pleasant vegan I spoke with on youtube who was willing to talk without arguing. We almost came to an agreement, but then they stopped answering. Youtube's fault. Their notification thing is shit. I have to track down old threads sometimes to answer people because even though they tagged my name, youtube didn't notify me that someone responded to me. So, I figure he just didn't get the notification that I responded. But where we ended up is I am willing to give up meat if certain criteria is met. The vegan meat must taste like the real thing. And all B12 and other supplements must be included into food without me having to read labels or keep track of doses. Basically, it needs to be just as convenient and tasty as real meat is. I'm even planning on going to Burger King to try their new veggie burger that they claim tastes like a regular burger. Was supposed to last week, but just my fucking luck that my car busted a hose right before getting there. I pulled into a parking spot and immediately saw steam coming up from my hood. I even said fuck it and went to go inside and figured I might as well eat since I'm there and deal with the car after since it was obviously just a hose and I lived only a couple blocks away. But just my damn luck again, they had a sign on the door that the inside was closed due to being understaffed and only the drive through was open. Well fucking thanks BK. The one thing I just became unable to do and it's the only way I can get that burger. God, you're an asshole sometimes. I was even tempted to push my car into the drive through just cause I'm very fucking determined once I set my mind on something. I wanted that damn burger and I still want to try it now. But all that aside, even if they did succeed at making a veggie burger taste like a real one, they'd be the only one. And it's still fast food. I can't live off BK veggie burgers. And yes, I am so addicted to meat that I'm not giving it up without something to take it's place that tastes just like it. And it would have to have the B12 added.

Anyway, I'm willing to be vegan if anyone can come up a meat substitute that actually tastes like the real thing and has all the stuff like B12 in it so I don't have to buy pills or supplements.

I‚Äôm a newbie to Veganism - currently transitioning from an omni diet. I‚Äôve probably got the same story as a lot of people as far as the transition goes - shame about my willful ignorance regarding factory farming, guilt about my environmental footprint as an omni, etc. 

Anyways, I‚Äôm happy to be making the transition now! I have a question that‚Äôs been weighing on me, though, and I‚Äôm hoping to ask it without coming across as offensive or ignorant, as that‚Äôs not my intent at all. Please forgive me for any mis-steps here! 

I‚Äôm curious about the environmental footprint of the Vegan ‚Äúimitation‚Äù foods on the market that are created to mimic dairy and meat. I must admit that I‚Äôm loving the beyond burgers, but they‚Äôre super over-packaged and I find that quite disappointing. That‚Äôs caused me to also consider all of the production and processing that goes into creating these imitation products, as well. The products themselves can be really good - but with all of the packaging and processing, what is their environmental impact? 

I‚Äôve seen a lot of conversation on the topic of the environmental cost of the meat and dairy industries, but does anyone know how the Vegan imitation food industry compares? 

Again, I mean no offence, so I‚Äôm very sorry if this comes across as offensive. I‚Äôm just curious about how I can move forward with my Vegan diet in a conscious and informed way - and with these industries growing so quickly, I do find some cause for concern.

3,Canadians: what hormones are in our milk?,"Hello vegans of Canada, 

I am wondering if someone could send me in the direction of good evidence indicating what hormones would be in our Canadian milk. 

I work at a cardiac rehab centre with a dietician. She is generally supportive of properly planned vegan diets, since the evidence and guidelines are supportive for our cardiac population. However, we started talking about milk over lunch because my coworkers daughter was told at school that milk could stimulate early puberty and periods. She said there were no hormones in our Canadian milk, as compared to the American market, so those fears are unfounded. 

I started reading more into it because I assumed any mammary secretion would have progesterone and estrogen. I see the difference between American and Canadian milk (as far as my research can tell) is that Canadian dairy farmers don‚Äôt use synthetic growth hormones. So I assume that‚Äôs what she was talking about, but don‚Äôt these hormones happen naturally in milk anyway? So I am curious if it is in fact true that dairy of Canada is hormone free (which I presume it is not), and I was also curious if anyone could send me toward some good Canadian resources that outline the amount of naturally occurring hormones in milk products in Canada?

I've had leather docs for about 5+ years (bought before I went vegan) which now need a replacement. 

I have an eye on the vegan 1461's. I've never had smelly feet, even after very long days of wearing hot weather. I do get smelly feet rather quickly in my sandals that have a synthetic footbed. Naturally I started  worrying if the same will happen in the vegan docs.

A second concern arose when I red the reviews on amazing. Most of which state that the sole of the docs broke after after about a year ...

16,Meal ideas with non-vegan family?,"My in-laws are planning a dinner for me, my SO, and my parents. I am the only vegan. Usually my in-laws will make their side dishes vegan (or I'll have to bake a potato separately while they make mashed, etc) and get me a meat replacement. That's not how I eat at home on a regular basis, but I appreciate them thinking of me and always trying to make something vegan even if they don't really understand what I eat/why I eat this way.

Anyway, back to the planned dinner party. My MIL said that she doesn't really want to have to cook multiple things...and wants to know what she can make that we can all enjoy together! I am so excited that she came up with this plan all on her own - this is a huge step coming from a woman who wouldn't even try the corn dish I made (using *her recipe* but subbing earth balance for butter) at Thanksgiving just two years ago.

Does anyone have any suggestions for a dinner we could make? My parents are used to eating vegan food and much less picky than my in-laws, who are pretty much meat-and-potatoes people and generally avoid spices or sauces. They would be willing to try something new, but nothing too ""weird"" for their palates.

Like?? What the fuck is this?

Before going vegan I never had a single person ask about my nutrients and I used to drink a bottle of wine everyday and live off take out . I am way healthier now. It's fucking ridiculous how no one ever cares about someone else's health until they are vegan (or overweight also Tbh).

24,"Dizzy, weak, and anxious, after switching to vegan diet - what should I do?","So I was following a mostly vegetarian diet with occasional (1-2 times per week) chicken and fish (no beef or pork). I would have dairy every day, usually cheese, yoghurt, or whey protein.

last week I switched to a full vegan diet after watching the movie Game Changers. I immediately (the very next day) began feeling very anxious, dizzy, and weak. I should mention I am quite athletic, working out with weights 3 times per week, running 2 times per week, and also doing boxing and rock-climbing. My main goal in going plant-based is to improve my athletic performance and to live longer.

After 4 days of dizziness I went back to my normal diet, having some seafood pasta, and then the next day eating chicken/dairy meals again, and immediately started feeling better. To be honest I felt better almost immediately after eating the non-vegan meal. This week I decided to try again starting the 100% vegan diet on Monday and now on Wednesday I'm feeling absolutely horrible again. Very dizzy and constantly anxious. I feel cold, tired, and very on edge basically.

&amp;#x200B;

My typical vegan diet is:

Breakfast - Toast with hummus, avocado, pumpkin seeds, tomato, spinach and kale, with vinegar dressing

Lunch - Protein shake (sun warrior protein) with oat milk, flaxceed, blueberries, spinach, peanut butter, and kiwi fruit

Before gym - 2 slices of bread with pistachio butter, banana, 2-4 medjool dates, and chia seeds

Dinner - Usually bean pasta, or bean burrito, lots of chillies. I mix up the vegetables each time. I put some vegan cheese on these dishes

Snacking - Either nuts, canned baked beans, hummus with crackers, or occasionally some dairy-free chocolate

Obviously I mix it up but these are kind of my staple meals.

28,This YT Mukbanger REALLY disturbs me! How is this allowed?,"First of all, I hate Mukbangs, and food eating videos, I think it's really f\*\*\*ing weird! But one has caught my attention and I didn't think it would bother me as much as it is, but after (regretfully) clicking the video without realizing what it was as it was in Korean, I learnt the horrible truth.

Youtuber Ssoyoung (I think that's how it's spelt) eats sea animals ALIVE! On Youtube...and I've been completely distraught since finding out about this channel and seeing what she's doing, all for monetary gain obviously and realizing how many people are watching her, I can't get this s\*\*t out of my head, I feel sick that this is what is considered entertainment and people enjoy watching this happen???

I reported the channel but I know nothing will be done, but how is something like this allowed? This is like that guy who sets traps, really really cruel traps for mice (which I'm still traumatized about to this day with the drowning one).

I don't understand what's going wrong in society, I don't understand why people enjoy this stuff why they feel the need to do it? Money isn't going to buy them immortality, it isn't going to give them the answers of the universe, it's just going to buy them some stupid s\*\*t that will be useless and pointless in a few years time.

I've been homeless before and without food before, and these videos actually make me physically sick but this Ssoyoung one topped it off with how disturbed she made me with her smiling and her cruel little face while doing it. I don't know, I just feel like I need people to know about this so maybe something can be done, I know it's probably pointless but it's really bothering me because I'm a huge animal lover, and care about their welfare and the environment and this stuff is getting to me that their making tons of money from being cruel and people are loving it.",vegan,Skylander1987,1572447555,3,True,2019-10-30

32,I sent this email to the CEO of my company today (Veganuary),"Can we count on your support? We (the Sustainability Advisory Council) are asking you to join us and take the pledge to reduce your meat consumption for the month of January. 

  
There are many good causes to advocate for and despite being very busy you find time to advocate for many. I really appreciate that, which is exactly why I have decided to reach out to you. 

  
As a member of the Sustainability Advisory Council I know that reducing carbon emissions is one of our primary sustainability goals. As an employee of a company which benefits from our society‚Äôs health and wellness I know improving health outcomes is important to us. As a pet owner and animal lover, I know that animals are thinking and feeling beings who deserve to be treated with compassion and respect. 

  
I hope you will keep an open mind when I say adopting a plant-based is one of the most important changes an individual can make for the betterment of our society (health outcomes) and environment (sustainability).   
This January, in observation of [Veganuary](https://veganuary.com/), I would love to challenge you to explore veganism for a day, a week, or even the whole month.¬†Below I have included compelling evidence that supports each of these aforementioned motives:   


Health  
There is a scientific consensus among major [health and dietetics](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/wiki/dieteticorgs) organizations that animal products are not required for us to live healthy lives. In fact, of the top ten leading causes of death in the US, 8 of them can be prevented, treated and sometimes reversed by adopting a plant-based diet. Dr. Micheal Greger (founder of [nutritionfacts.org](https://nutritionfacts.org/)) goes into detail in his video citing studies which provide proof of this statement.

\*Preventable or reversible with a plant-based diet. Source:¬†[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30gEiweaAVQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30gEiweaAVQ)   


Sustainability  
Consumption of animal products has devastating impact on our planet, both locally and globally.   


* Livestock emissions make up \~18% of global man-made greenhouse gases. (Cars are only responsible for only \~14%!)

* Eating just a single portion of beef is equivalent to driving a car 20 miles in terms carbon emissions.

* Milk per water usage \~1080 gallons per 1 gallon of milk

* Beef has a 3% calorie conversion ratio. Meaning 97% of calories are lost when corn/soy feed is converted to beef.

Ethics  
If we accept that we don‚Äôt need to consume animals to live healthy lives. And we accept that animal abuse is wrong. Then how can we not consider what we do to livestock animals abuse even in the most humane of circumstances? How can we rationalize confining and killing animals for our palate pleasure? 

  
Most people who have a pet are appalled by the idea of killing and eating that pet. But that is exactly what we do with the animals we choose to eat. The difference between a cow, dog, cat or pig is minimal. Not unlike human differences such as race, gender, height or hair color. Treating people differently based on those physical traits is unethical, but in the case of animals we tend to look the other way.   


What we can do:

By reducing our meat consumption \[Company\] can be a leader in sustainability. Of course people love meat and love their traditions. A gentle approach is necessary to give people the opportunity to make different choices than normal. This is something we should encourage. 

  
During the month of January there is a movement called ‚ÄúVeganuary.‚Äù During this event people are asked to take a pledge to attempt veganism for a month. I would like us to encourage our \[Company\] family to take this pledge through communication and signage. More importantly, I would like to facilitate adoption of a plant-based diet by requesting the Cafeterias make some reasonable accommodations for those who are making new choices for the month. 

  
Here are some changes the Cafeteria staff have agreed to implement to help this campaign:   


* A vegan soup option always available 
* Increase frequency of vegan options 
   * Vegetarian wellness meals modified to be vegan (hummus instead of feta etc‚Ä¶) 
   * Tofu or other meat alternatives presented in context with BYO meals like pho, taco or baked potato bar 
* Beyond burgers are available 
* Non dairy milk alternative for breakfast 

Convincing people to participate is where you come in. Having your support and advocacy for this initiative will go a long way towards encourage the population to take the pledge. Even a commitment to eat plant-based during work hours would be profound. The best news is, we can derive metrics from veganuary and actually show a reduction in carbon emissions company-wide by looking at cafeteria sales data.   
If each of our \~3000 associates chooses to avoid eating beef just once during the month, we as an organization would avoid adding \~23,000kg of carbon emissions into the atmosphere and save nearly 1 million gallons of water. 

  
Thank you for taking the time to read this. I look forward to hearing back from you, and I truly hope we can work together to make some sweeping changes in people‚Äôs eating habits for the benefit of everyone.",vegan,VirtualAlex,1572449325,8,True,2019-10-30

Not gonna lie, its gonna take me some time before I can actually go vegan. Currently, its an inconvenience on everyone if I try to make my own meals, so I just end up with what everyone is eating.

So I've decided to go vegan.

The only non-vegan thing I will do is wear and use the leather and wool I already bought until they wear out and then purchase vegan alternatives when I'm replacing them.

Does anyone have any tips on how to do this without vitamin deficiency? I know a lot of vegans eat a lot of nuts and nut products, but those will literally kill me... :p

108,I think it's about time I make the change.,"TL:DR - Wanting to switch the veganism and could use some suggestions on how to get started.


I grew up in a pretty traditional christian household where my sisters helped my mother with ""womanly"" tasks while my father and I did ""manly"" things like cut wood and hunt/fish. Over time both my sisters have become vegans, one for about 6 years now and the other just over 1. I fiddled around with being vegetarian shortly and was suprised as to how easy it was for me considering how most claim they , ""could never not eat meat"". Though I didn't stick to it as I was honestly just too lazy and still a very busy highschooler as well as living under my parents roof. Changing my whole diet was just too much for me then.

Come around to today where I make most my meals and have a lot more time. Honestly, I just can't think of a reason not to be vegan besides it being a process that takes a lot of time and energy to fully adapt to and do your due diligence. I think it's time for me to take the dive as I feel that underlining guilt while eating / consuming animal products and see no reason not to transition. + Save the Earth :)

So, my main concern is making sure I am still getting all of my nutrients and vitamins and all that crap as well as it just being daunting and overwhelming.  

I would appreciate any tips you guys can offer as well as some lesser known things to watch out for. For example, my sister recently told me how she doesn't wear silk as it comes from silk worms. I had no idea...

Now.... I eat exactly the same but with vegan butter on my toast, vegan goujons etc etc.... basically, I don‚Äôt eat much veg (although I‚Äôll have nice healthy chilli a couple days of a week and sometimes a cheeky spinach smoothie, maybe twice a week)

Is it really true that an unhealthy vegan diet is worse than an unhealthy non-vegan diet? As lots of people who claim they got sick after going vegan just eat normal unhealthy-ish foods anyway.

174,Too much B12?,"I saw a post on here the other day about B12 potentially contributing to acne. I hope it's okay to post again as I'm looking for some advice.

I currently take a daily Vegan multivitamin with 2.5ug of B12, and I also take a lot of oatly oat milk daily in my tea and cereal, which is fortified with B12.

Recently I have been experiencing regular breakouts which has coincided with my turning vegan. Could this be due to too much B12?

Will I be getting enough B12 simply from the oat milk so I can cut out the multivitamin?

182,"I am going vegan, but very concerned about food allergies and complications.","I watched a video of a baby calf cuddling its mother, and admittedly for a good 20 minutes, I lost all control over my emotions and began to break down into whimpering and heavy tears. 

My father and I used to cuddle on the couch together and watch cartoons when i was much younger. We've always been very tightly nit and I saw me and my father in that video of the cows. I don't want to tear apart a family of cows or any animal ever again. I grew a conscious for my actions of when I consume meat. Animals feel emotion, love, fear, and pain just like us, and I don't think I can ever forgive myself for not going vegan sooner. I was a vegetarian in 7th grade - 8th grade for health relsted issues, and I had a lot more energy and lost a lot of weight in the process. My only concern is I ate a lot of frozen and processed vegetarian food during that time. I am a junior in highschool now. I have decided that I am going vegan and nothing is going to stop me, but i am mildly nervous about my food allergies and making meals.

I've never been one to consume large amounts of dairy, as I am severely lactose intolerant and digesting more than a glass of milk or 4 tablespoons of any dairy product would send me into a 48 hour cycle of puking and diarrhea. Eggs are very hard for me to digest as well, and give me diarrhea. As I'm going vegan, skipping dairy will be no issue. 

I do have more severe food allergies- like wheat, almond milk, brown rice, barley, coconut, peanut butter, brown beans, eggplant, artificial sugar, and rye. 

Will my allergies get in the way of homemade vegan meals and I have to strictly eat high protein foods and vegetables to stay healthy, or are there alternatives I am unaware about?",vegan,DeadlyDominick,1572511426,6,True,2019-10-31

I do understand that, but does the same count for canned (I imagine it's the same for the product in the second link, it is glass, but it is under pressure and in some kind of liquid) kidney beans? If yes, how would you cook/boil the canned kidney beans to get rid of the toxicity. Also, once they have been cooked/boiled, how long will they last in the fridge?

237,"""But the idea that they should avoid negative reaction by being less ""angry"" is folly...""","Activist friends, don't be afraid to be unapologetic. Don't let the fear of disapprobation from your peers prevent you from speaking the truth about injustice. Social upheaval is uncomfortable and it is meant to be. Disruption is a normal and necessary part of meaningful change. As vegans especially we are shamed into being docile and quiet through the stereotype of the ""angry"" vegan. This is a stereotype meant to keep us from disrupting the status quo and making change. Nobody on either side wants to be uncomfortable and as humans we have a strong aversion to isolating ourselves and inviting peer disapproval. But that doesn't mean that it is the wrong approach. In fact, it may be one of the most effective tools we have available. Excerpt from This is An Uprising:

""Certainly, activists can work to be creative in their actions and present themselves in ways that break with typical protest cliches. But the idea that they should avoid negative reaction by being less ""angry"" is folly. The major social movements of the past two centuries have consistently proven wrong the advice that activists do better to appear civil and minimize confrontation. The most well-known quote from famed abolitionist Frederick Douglass eloquently addresses this very topic: 'If there is no struggle, there is no progress,' Douglass stated in 1857. 'Those who profess to favor freedom and yet depreciate agitation are men who want crops without plowing up the ground, they want rain without thunder and lightning. They want the ocean without the awful roar of its many waters.'""",vegan,Revenna_,1572534512,0,True,2019-10-31
239,Why do people who are informed dont go vegan?,"First of all sorry for any mistakes because English is not my first language. 

My husband is a sensitive person, loves animals, always had pets and is not indiferent to any animal abuse he sees.
Im vegetarian (almost vegan tbh) and he watched Cowspiracy with me. He knows every freakin' argument on why to become vegan. Whenever we get in an argument with friends or family he kinda has my back and understands everything. 

We never watched Earthling or Dominion because I just cant take it but we did watch a few short YouTube videos about slaughter houses, which were enough (i think) to have that ""shock effect"". 

He usually eats what I cook, so he is vegan for most of the week (although most of the time its because dinner is ready and he doesnt feel like cooking something else). 
But whenever we go to the Supermarket together (most of the time I go by myself) he always brings some meat/eggs and things I dont ever buy. 

So ofc the mindset is not stuck with him. He does not feel what I feel, and doesnt think that he is actually eating an animal.

In the past I did get frustrated by this. I tried changing his mind and even considered something like: ""i dont want to be with a person who does not understand this"". But over time I understood that I was just wasting my time, so whenever I see meat in the fridge I dont even react anymore. 

You know that feeling when you become vegan and understand meat and dairy industrie and you think: I just dont have a choice here.

Some people I do understand why dont become vegan because they dont really care about animals or the enverioment, dont have a concience mind about anything... We all have that one friend that we know its almost Impossible to convert.

So my concern about this subject is: why? why some people that we consider intelligent and sensitive just dont become vegan? Maybe if I trully understand the way they think I might bem able to be a bit more compreensive. 

Im not sure how to trully express my questions, but I would like to hear some stories about people close to you, with all the informations and knowledge, that you actually consider good people, that simply dont cross the bridge.

Now six years on, im a lot busier due to work and other commitments and cooking is an absolute chore, so my diet is as follows, pretty much 80% of the time:

Morning:
Big smoothie (200g oats, spinach, frozen blueberries, 5/6 bananas)

Lunch/Dinner:
A big bowl of rice and red lentils with mixed vegetables, topped off with some curry sauce for some flavour.

How can i round this out? I recognise this is probably not a wholistic diet, im looking for things that i can consistently add, i have absolutely no passion for cooking and treat it like a robotic chore that i want to do as quickly as possible unless im eating with friends.

So I have been a vegetarian for 8 years and about a few months ago I found out I was lactose intolerant. I had been thinking that I want to become a vegan before finding out I was lactose intolerant, so I thought it would  be the perfect time to start my transition. I have pretty much totally cut out animal products with just a little further to go. 

So the thing is, my family are all omnivores and when I go to visit I stay with my Mom. Everytime I go, she asks what to buy me to make food for myself while I am staying with her and I usually tell her to get me rice, legumes, fruits, and veggies. She always ends up getting me pretty much cheese and bread. I don't know why, but I just try to be appreciative that she is making an effort to get me food that I can eat. Now that I am almost totally vegan (and probably totally by the time I go to visit next), I am not sure if I should just tell my Mom to skip out on buying me food. I don't want her to spend money on food that I can't eat and waste her money trying to be nice to me. 

What do you guys think?

266,Veganism and family tensions,"Hello,

First, I would just like to say that my English is not very good. So I decided to write my message in my native language and use Google Translate. Thank you for your understanding.

Me and my parents would like advice on how to solve a family problem that persists with our recent transition to veganism. Me and my mother have been vegetarian for about 5 years. Our diet was mainly vegetal, but we sometimes made exceptions during social events. Over time, we were more and more interested in the transition to a 100% vegan diet and lifestyle. Since about 2 months, it's done.


I am writing to you because this sudden transition causes tensions within our family. I am 18 years old and I still live with my father and my mother. My sister at 23 and she lives in a house with her spouse. Family dinners are the only occasions we are all together. A little more about my sister and her boyfriend: they are very large carnivores. We are talking about animal consumption in the morning, noon and night, and especially ""red meat"". They also own 3 dogs, fed exclusively with raw animal products. When we were occasional vegans, the dinners went particularly well. We used to serve them a separate dish containing meat while we ate our vegan dish. When it was our turn to eat in their home, it was the opposite: they were preparing a vegan alternative.

Recently, we made the decision to no longer cook dishes that contain animal products. The reasons are many: we feel an intellectual discomfort to cook animal products, we do not want to use our instruments and put them in contact with the meat, we believe that the animal welfare should be primordial and finally that it is very bad for the environment. We mentioned to them that we would like them to taste vegan food, but the message is not easy. They say that we could ""make an effort"" to serve them a dish with animal products, because in the same logic, they should not do the same thing when we go to eat at home. Basically, they say '' if you want us to eat your food, you just have to eat our home ''. I can understand their logic because I myself have been omnivorous in the past.

What do you think? How would you approach the problem with my sister and spouse? Personally it does not bother me that we do not eat together, but I see that it causes a lot of trouble to my mother.

I thought maybe some of you lived in the same situation. The situation is quite complex so I tried to be brief. Thank you for your help",vegan,Veganism12345,1572542048,4,True,2019-10-31

292,2 weeks in... Wow. Potlucks are BRUTAL.,"It hasn't been the easiest two weeks for me. But its been great, and enlightening, and eye opening.

Today is the office lunch potluck for Halloween. I signed up to bring something, and I thought about bringing a vegan dish, but I figured no-one would care except for me.

So I used up some of the eggs that are aging in my fridge and some of the mayo to make deviled eggs. They smelled so gross when I was making them! It was bizarre! I love(d) eggs, but the smell of them was disgusting even after just two weeks.

There was probably 30-40 dishes... MASSIVE potluck. I was trying not be anti social, so I went and hung out while everyone filled up their plates, and surveyed the carnage to see if there was anything I could snack on. There was literally not one single dish without animal in it. Not one.

There was the obligatory untouched veggie tray with a bucket of ranch, so I scooped up a few veggies, but other than that, the closest thing was a pretty legit looking pasta salad, that upon closer inspection had cubes of cheese in it.

Bean dips covered in sour cream and cheese, meatballs, lil smokies wrapped in bacon, pumpkin pie, cupcakes, cakes, puddings. 

I would have gone apeshit on this spread two weeks ago. Then I would have wanted to crawl under my desk and die.

Not going to lie, I still kinda wanted to, but I was also a bit put off by all the food. I remembered loving it, but I didn't want to eat it. I put in my minimum social obligation, then warmed up my delicious vegan lunch and chowed down.

What is the best evidence that you have in favor of a vegan diet for treating fatty liver?","My doctor, who is a vegan, recently diagnosed me with fatty liver disease, and suggested I stop eating all animal fats. She recommended that I cut out almost all meats and dairy and eat a lot of fibrous vegetable/plant carbs (beets, green beans, fruit, etc...).





A different medical professional, from a different country (I live in between France and the US, moving every four months for work), suggested the complete opposite. This medical professional suggested I adopt a keto diet with a lot of fats, medium protein, and absolutely no carbs at all.





The worst seems like a high carb, high animal fat diet, which is what I ate before. I've also read that a low carb and low fat diet is very dangerous. 





After a few days of low animal fat and low carb, I don't think I can do vegan and keto at the same time. I just hate the taste of both olives and avocados, almost all sources of plant fat, and many make me feel sick to my stomach.




I probably could sustain a carbs + vegan diet with only a few difficulties, and I definitely sustain a high fat vegan diet.

Also, traditionally, Christmas dinner at home was meat fondue (aka a pot of soup on the table and everyone cooks bits of meat over the course of 2-3 hours).

Now, I'm living \~8 hours travel from my family, so I see them maybe once a year, which is why my mother was devastated when I told here we wouldn't be coming because ""joining in on the fondue is rather pointless"" (and disturbing, as I see it now). Also, as stated before, I was told beforehand that they wouldn't conform my wishes, which is why I didn't think of suggesting an alternative. However, after convincing my mom it's not just some excuse but an actual problem for me, she herself suggested we have an alternative. I was quite happy about this and told her my girlfriend and me could prepare a nice (vegan) dinner for the evening. 

All seemed well to me until I phoned my sister today, who responded to this change of plans with ""Ok so we can prepare one vegan dish and one with meat"". Now, I don't really see why we would need to go through the trouble of preparing two dishes if everyone could just as well eat the vegan dish. And, to be honest, us two vegans only decided to join the Christmas dinner with the prospect of having a meat-free evening. After some ""why can't everybody have what they want"", ""why is this a problem for you"", ""you vegans are so complicated"", ""so typical, all plans have to be made according to you vegans"" etc. the call ended (badly).

Am I overreacting to this ""make two dishes"" thing? How do you handle others insisting on meat? 

I'm not sure whether Christmas with the whole family will happen now - as it stands, either me or my sister will not join, in which case I would feel bad for my mom. But how can I make them see that this is really uncomfortable for me? Or should I just ignore the meat and go on their terms? Am i being egoistical for holding my values over my family even though I love them too?

Thanks for reading this far, and maybe you (yes, you!) can provide some insights for helping me to make a decision.",vegan,Fylmidei,1572567943,11,True,2019-10-31

372,"The word ""Vegan"" does not do justice to our cause.","I have always felt like the word ""vegan"" does not do justice to our cause.

Veganism primarily focuses on the alleviation of animal suffering but the word stem ""veg"" seems to get omnis thinking that what vegans really like is their veggies. It gets lumped into the same category as vegetarian.

Veganism is not a diet. It is an ethical position.

As someone who is on day 4 of the vegan journey and was an omni, I believe that this was what made it hard to take veganism seriously at the start. When I reconnected it to the animal suffering aspect, I instantly had a change of heart.

Perhaps veganism would have been more convincing to omnis at face value had it been termed something like ""compassionism"" or whatever smart thing someone can come up with. Ideally, the word should have been about a human value like peace/non-violence instead of the word ""veg""?

380,Fuck me for wanting to be nice for the animals,"My dad told me that me not eating meat is like me thinking that I'm better than God because he put the animals here for us to eat and I won't eat them. I then said that I don't eat animals because it isn't needed anymore. He said that it is needed. I said that we have plenty of plant based foods to eat that can provide us with a balanced diet. He said that pleasure in food is important. I said that I find pleasure in the food that I eat. He then made the ""but bacon"" argument and said that God wouldn't give us bacon just to take it away for us.

I dropped the subject as it wasn't going anywhere. He then asked me if I was going to do the dishes. I told him I'd do them if the food we ate didn't contain meat. He called that BS and said that I should move out. I told him that I am moving out in a month and he made a comment that he didn't mean about me moving out immediately.

I love my father. He's not a bad guy and I don't want to paint him as such. He's an extremely hard worker and has always done all that he can to provide for our family. It's just hard when we both feel very strongly about opposite views on something. This is so important to me. I'm a new vegetarian who aspires to be vegan and literally have zero support and hear ridicule every single day. I'm worried that I'm going to crack under the pressure. I wish that I didn't need to eat food. My life would be so much easier that way.

396,"10 day vegan - Energy, and a new lease on life!","I consider myself a very critical person, and I never take wild claims seriously. ""It would give you energy, it will help you loose weight, it will clear your skin, it will lift your mood, etc."" Most of those claims associated with veganism I considered to either be hype, outright bull, or something that wouldn't work for me.

I decided to start a whole food plant diet, simply because the evidence has been accumulating for so long, that it prolongs longevity and better health outcomes, that I couldn't continue to ignore it.   
Also because despite the fact I  strictly ate what is considered a healthy diet, and I was not healthy. I have Ulcerative Colitis and in the last year I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis. I'm 29 y.o. I have an amazing team of doctors, and the latest drug treatment I'm on is really good, and is helping me tremendously, but despite that my outlook on the future is grim. How long will the biologic medication stop working for me, just like all the previous meds had. Before I need surgery, or I become disabled, or I develop another chronic condition?

Only two days on the whole food plant diet I was feeling energetic. You don't know how much that means to me. People like me with chronic illness have a term to describe the struggle of low energy - [The Spoon Theory](https://butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/) &lt; I suggest everyone who doesn't know about it to read the link, and then go and hug the spoonies in their life.  
I would feel drained every day, have to skip on seeing family and friends to rest. Balance the pros and cons of going grocery shopping when I would be too tired when I come back to cook, and so much more. Your whole mindset changes, and the people around you get used to you saying no to them constantly, and eventually stop inviting you.

Only two days on the whole food plant based diet, and I felt better than I ever had before. I was so stupidly happy I ran up and down the stairs each chance I got. This influx of energy has not abated, I now exercises 15-20 minutes every day, simply because I have too much energy, something that would previously would've left me incapacitated for the day, or following day. The thought of doing it daily, would've been unthinkable. I'm waking up rested, and energized! It's amazing!

I hope this becomes my new normal, but I also don't want to ever forget, what a gift it is, to have the capacity to do the things I want in a day, and not be utterly drained all the time. 

Does anyone know - why? Why do vegans experience this jump in energy? I was not able to found a lot on the subject online, and its not talked about much, only mentioned.

I knew the environmental harm, I had spent years ignoring the welfare issues I couldn't reconcile with and I had had enough. I was fucking done. I'm almost at my year point of veganism. I stopped buying cows milk for home about two years ago, I had already been using only vegan toiletries and cosmetics for years. I was sitting in my backyard, thinking about the contents of my fridge and pantry. All that stood between me and actioning my values was one serving of cheese. Like giving up meat, I was fucking done. I felt like a hypocrite. I regret my years spent as a vegetarian, doing as much harm to the planet and animals as omnis. But I don't regret the initial decision to stop eating meat and I don't regret the decision to stop all animal products.

&gt; ""A factor for low efficacy is that most influenza-vaccine viruses are propagated in eggs, and the vaccine virus changes during egg-based production in ways that facilitate replication in eggs but reduce vaccine effectiveness against circulating virus.""

&gt; ""A key change appears to be a mutation in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein that mediates receptor binding by neutralizing antibodies, according to a recent study from researchers at the Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.  The researchers identified an HA glucosylation site that was lost during egg adaptation but remained in circulating influenza A (H3N2) strains.""

453,How do you handle being vegan considering the amount of non-dietary products that come from animals?,"Hi,

I recently had a discussion with a friend about veganism. Neither of us is vegan but I was taking a defensive stance because I believe that regardless of if you are vegan for animal cruelty or some other reason, I recognize that cattle has a huge impact on the environment in terms of emissions. 

His point was that there's no 100% vegan, and/or that it's illogical to call yourself vegan. The reason for this is because so many of the products in our society come from animals, so in the end you're still contributing to the killing/mistreatment of animals. He showed me [this image](http://huntergatherer.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/500/no_such_thing_as_a_vegan.jpg). Now I haven't fact checked all of them and he did say that a few of those are not true anymore (e.g. instrument strings which are mostly made of steel now) but I did check pills and according to my research most capsules are indeed made from animal product.

463,Finally made the switch,"I did it guys, I finally transitioned to a vegan diet.

Awhile ago I posted here about my struggles transitioning. I had severe food intolerances to main staples like beans, legumes, gluten, and just about any grain. Each attempt was met with pain, blood, and a renewed frustration. You all had some suggestions, but in the end I felt like nothing would work and I was stuck eating this way forever.

Fast forward two years later. Went through one of the hardest times of my life. I was financially in the hole and I had to cut out meat to save money. I didn‚Äôt need it to survive, I knew that. I was vegetarian at this point and I felt alright. I started slowly introducing the foods that made me sick before, a little at a time. They still affected me, but not as much. Even though I had a negative reaction I kept at it. A little bit at a time I felt my gut biome adjusting and being able to digest everything. Oh my god, is it finally happening?

It‚Äôs been about 3 months on a vegan diet and I feel great. My workouts at the gym have improved, I don‚Äôt hit walls as often, and I recover quicker. I also have so much energy that I have a hard time falling asleep at night if I don‚Äôt work out or do something physically strenuous that day. I fart all the time it seems, but according to the internet that‚Äôs normal and it‚Äôs better than being in pain or bleeding.

One year ago I stopped eating meat and any animal products. When I was younger my family gave me horses and ofcourse I was happy because I just thought it was nice. I have already realized that they are not mine to own and not mine to ride. 

Prooooblem is, that how it is in Norway is like- they‚Äôre outside during the winter just doing their own thing and we take them to our homes in like January and we ride them and keep them fit and they just live in the field next to my home. 

So the problem is that if they‚Äôre not ridden, like if you don‚Äôt keep them fit, they will get obese if they‚Äôre just left alone in the fields all year around, they‚Äôre not adjusted to just being alone and they don‚Äôt run that much so they just keep eating and keep getting fatter; even so far that they get diabetes. 

So I don‚Äôt want to ride my horses anymore but I do not either want them to eat themselves to death. I can‚Äôt go out like walking with them because they don‚Äôt burn enough just by walking or trotting next to me.

I have no idea how to feel so I figured I would ask this community. Reasons it might be okay: the US completely fucked over the Native Alaskan's way of life and now they have to sell ivory art and wares to make money in order to survive in their westernized economies, plus it is part of cultural traditions. I do not wish to infringe on their hunting or other cultural practices, but also choose to not partake for obvious reasons. But that might be the reason to not want to purchase ivory art, because while I agree that they should be allowed to continue their traditions, I don't have to take part...except for the fact that unlike hunting, there has to be outside involvement in order for them to benefit.

88,It's hard to be a vegan.,"Many people believe that being vegan is hard and that is absolutely true, although it is hard for different reasons than they think. Personally i'm on the verge of breaking down due to how freaking hard it is.

I am not an activist nor i promote veganism to the people that surround me. I was doing it in the beginning of my journey, but i have lost fate in that - people are just too afraid to admit they have been wrong their whole life.

Here are the reasons it is very hard for me to be a vegan:

- Everyone around me LOVES animals, they consider themselves animal lovers and yet no one actually gives a damn about animals based on their day to day dietary choices. And when i point their hipocricy out in the softest possible way, i am being laughed at.

- Everyone is an advocate for making changes for the climate, yet no one is actually willing to change for it. They are verbalising the need to do something with a mouth full of animal products. And when i point that out, i am being annoying.

- Everyone KNOWS that You HAVE to consume animal products to sustain good health in Your body, yet they are going in and out of hospital all the time with mostly diet related problems. They seem to know more about the risks that one is exposed to when not consuming animal products, but know nothing about the risks of consuming those products. And here i don't even have to point out anything to get a weekly reminder from my *family* of how i will develop deseases and deficiencies and how my children will be stupid.

The ignorance of people is just killing me. I think it's so hard because i don't have any friends and i could only wish for vegan ones just to remind each other that we are doing this for something bigger than ourselves. Thankfully there are communities like this, where i can relax for at least half an hour.

Just wanted to get this off my chest as i am really really tired of it.

My gf has developed a fructose malabsorption (even before turning vegan) and that's probably what's causing her stomach pain every single day. We already try to eat very little sugar, no fruits etc. but it doesn't help because fructose is everywhere... 

According to the doctor she should live completely fructose-free for 1 month and after that slowly start to increase fructose intake over time. 

But living fructose-free as a vegan is really hard. ""Normal"" people could just rely on meat and dairy products but that's not an option, of course.

93,Invertebrate/Arthropod Pets,"Greetings, fellow soyboys and -girls. 

I know what you are thinking - yet another clueless fool asking whether it is morally okay for vegans to keep pets. Do not worry though, this is not the millionth thread about cats and dogs. (If it has less than six legs, it's boring anyways.)

What I am interested in are animals like insects, spiders, myriapods, crustaceans... You know the deal. 

Obviously, carnivores are out. No problem, there are many herbivores to choose from. Millipedes are wonderful (and really cute) animals who happen to be herbivores. Cockroaches, though technically omnivores, do great on a plant-based diet as well. Phasmids are vegans who spend their entire lives sitting on the plants they eat. A lot of isopods (arguably the best animals ever, don't @ me) feed on mold and decaying plant material. 

But food isn't really the problem. No, acquiring the animals in the first place is. You can't exactly walk into an animal shelter and ask for a millipede (well, you could, but they would probably just laugh at you), so the only option are private breeders. Usually, animal breeding is a no-no, for understandable reasons. Is this also true in the case of pet inverts/arthropods though? Do you think purchasing them from a breeder is unethical? 

Most people will probably say that it doesn't matter, since the vast majority of invertebrates are likely incapable of experiencing pain or suffering anyways. And hey, who knows, maybe those people are right. We simply don't know yet, and possibly never will. 

The thing is, I like these animals a lot. They are so fascinatingly diverse, so strangely beautiful - there is something truly awe-inspiring about watching them. I know it sounds silly and stupid, but I really respect them, much like other people respect cats and dogs. If there is even a small chance of them being able to suffer, I wouldn't want to risk making them do so. 

The best option would probably be taking over an existing group of animals from someone who doesn't want to keep them anymore. I sadly don't know anyone in this situation though, and even on Ebay Kleinanzeigen (my country's version of Craigslist) there never seems to be anyone.

Also, what about exotic species not native to Europe? Two very commonly kept examples would be the Giant African Millipede and the Madagascar Hissing Cockroach. If you buy animals of either species from a breeder, they are almost always locally bred and not imported from their native countries - does that make it okay though? The animals themselves probably don't care as long as they are kept in a terrarium appropriate to their needs, but you would still be supporting the breeder financially.

Those items won't be there forever; just until more people warm up to this no cheese, no egg lifestyle.  I'll be honest, cheese and eggs took me longer, too.  \[Fun Fact: I was eating 4-6 eggs per day for many months before I went vegan-- not even bragging but it gives you an idea about how much I actually used to enjoy eating those crazy fluids.  Has anyone tried Just Egg Scramble btw?  I'm curious about it\]

If y'all have any family members, friends, or even enemies in the area who feel they can't yet give up cheese and are curious about vegan meats, send them our way!  I definitely want to see the vegan food restaurants spread like wildfire through our area (and everywhere), so the more people we can introduce to some fast, delicious vegan food, the faster more people will be inclined to go vegan and the faster we can let go of the 'vegetarian' part of the title.

129,Just wanted to say thanks!,"I‚Äôve lurked this sub for about a year now so here‚Äôs my story:

A little over 2 years ago I went vegetarian (sort of by default) while on vacation as I had food poisoning the previous night and I was worried to upset my stomach more while eating meat. I was with all of my extended family on this vacation and I remember them asking me so many questions about why I got a rice and veg plate, literally attacking me for my dinner choice. It was ridiculous and I told myself I‚Äôm not going to eat meat the rest of the week to piss everyone off, and boy were they mad. I come from a huge Latino family so they‚Äôve always been big meat eaters and this didn‚Äôt sit well with my parents. It had gotten to the point where I was continually getting in fights with my mom and dad about how it‚Äôs concerning that I don‚Äôt eat the food they make and how they were done accommodating to me as far as shopping for my food which is literally vegetables and non dairy milk lol, my dad went as far to accuse me of trying to be trendy? Not sure where he got that from. 

Fast forward to my 1 year vegetarian anniversary, my dad went vegetarian for 3 months, my mom went and is currently pescatarian, my boyfriend went vegetarian a month after we met plus my best friend and one of my cousins are both vegetarian. I feel like my habits are slowly affecting those around me. I understand that they could be doing so much more but I‚Äôm happy they‚Äôve attempted to become more open minded. 

Last week I‚Äôve decided it‚Äôs time for myself to go vegan 100%. My intention to omit meat 2 years ago was selfish at first and purposefully in spite of others opinions, now I don‚Äôt eat meat because I want to respect our earth and the living creatures that inhabit it. 

I wanted to write this because I appreciate everyone of you who have had the courage to stand up for the animals who can‚Äôt or to stand your ground to people who just write you off as trendy or complicated.

139,What would you do if your meal was made incorrectly?,"Hey guys. It‚Äôs been exactly 1 month of being vegan! I was a strict lacto-vegetarian before.

If you order food at a restaurant, say a pasta dish, &amp; say no cheese. And they bring it out with cheese on it, would you eat it?

I‚Äôm trying to figure out my place as a vegan. I ask because I ordered food &amp; was given something with cheese (which before being vegan I would eat) but obviously not now. Luckily I had a friend there who ate what they messed up while I just went home &amp; made food. But I hate wasting food period (kinda getting into vegan zero waste!!). I‚Äôve sent back food at restaurants for putting meat in it but that‚Äôs because I‚Äôve never eaten meat in my life. I have asked my friends who work at restaurants what happens to the food that is sent back &amp; they told me it is thrown away.

Naturally if I were to eat something with cheese/dairy on it, I wouldn‚Äôt call myself a vegan. But does it make me a bad person if I were to eat something, for example a pasta dish that they put mozzarella on by accident, versus sending it back, having it thrown away?

I just am thinking in terms of the value of for example that cow‚Äôs life. I LOVE COWS SO MUCH :( If I could singlehandedly end factory farming, I would.

But idk, I‚Äôm really just trying to figure out what I am &amp; am not okay with. My family being from a third world country, wasting food has never been okay. I‚Äôm still the type of person to literally scrape a bowl clean to avoid wasting food. So idk, if anyone has any thoughts let me know.",vegan,PomegranateObsessor,1569906897,61,True,2019-10-01

We've published three anthologies of year's best [vegan-friendly SFF](https://books.metaphorosis.com/best-vegan-sff/) so far, and we've just reissued all three with new covers by vegan artist [Bonnie Leeman](http://bonniemarieleeman.daportfolio.com/) \- who also did covers for the next two in the series.

These aren't stories *about* vegans or veganism. They're not advocacy. They're just good SFF stories that don't happen to include meat eating, leather, horse-riding, etc. Stories you can read without skipping over those parts.

If you like SFF, take a look - they're in e-book and paperback format. If you write, and you've sold an SFF story this year, keep your eyes open for the submission period late in the year.

If you're a committed vegan SFF writer, contact me here or via the Metaphorosis.com About page. A long-term plan is an SFF anthology by vegan authors.",vegan,BMorrisAllen,1569951618,0,True,2019-10-01

I'll add a teaser but please respond in comments on the google doc:

* Eating meat that is produced regeneratively (i.e., organic, grassfed/pasture-raised) will produce better soil, sequester carbon from the air (net carbon sink), increase biodiversity, reduce drought, prevent runoff, and overall be a net positive for the environment.
* Meat is the most nutrient-dense food one can eat, and is the biologically optimal food for humans - it is what we are best adapted to consume.
* Ethics - if the above two are true, then it is unequivocally ethical to eat meat; i.e., it would be unethical for a society to abstain from meat consumption because this would lead to, on average, significantly poorer health outcomes for the populace (including early death, but also poor quality of life). It would also be unethical for a society to abstain from meat because this would result in continued environmental degradation, loss of biodiversity, and unsustainability of food production.",vegan,JRogan92,1569960040,21,True,2019-10-01

I LOVE to cook and I love even more to cook for others, and to eat my creations. After I graduate next December, I plan to open a Vegan cafe in my town. It would be extremely difficult-impossible even- to achieve my dream of graduating and becoming a chef without participating in the acts I'm so against. Am I a horrible person for considering this? It would only be for a year, and my omni roommates already agreed into trying the animal-product-ridden food and giving me a detailed report so I dont have to participate. I hate the thought of having to do this. Maybe I could taste the ""food"" and spit it out? Or try my damndest to avoid those products?

I pretty much had 90% of my energy and went outside to do some chores without any issue.

I subscribed 2+ years ago to learn more about it. I waited far longer than I should have to make the switch but I'm recovering from an eating disorder and was wary of restricting my diet in any way, for a long time. 

I decided to give it a try and eat entirely vegan for the month of September, with the caveat that if I lapsed into disordered eating I would stop immediately. 

WTF YOU GUYS. IT WAS SO EASY. And I feel so much better. I can't believe I waited so long. Eating vegan doesn't feel restricting. It's freeing. 

I will say, it is kind of a bummer when people bring in treats to work. I'll just have to be the one bringing in treats from now on lol. By far the most annoying part was people's reaction to me eating vegan (despite me making every effort NOT to talk about it).

Sorry, but the ideology of veganism will never fool me and I will always eat animal products and plants. I am healthy, strong, and not vegan. I didn't push my views on you telling you what to eat, drink, and live. I just told you what I am eating and drinking. See how reasonable I am?

Also I am not worried at all about food and climate change and the scare tactics used by vegans. Agriculture, forestry, and other land use accounts for approx 4%\*. Why would I give up any food to save that 4% pollution, ridiculous. Most if not all of my food is local. Meat, dairy, eggs, bread, some fruit, all local. Meanwhile many plant based foods are not local, which uses lots of emissions from transportation, packaging, etc... Again, more misinformation being spread acting like animal products are worse for environment, not true at all, especially if local...

I fried up about a third of a large white onion and some garlic in coconut oil. Threw in a can of chick peas, black eyed, and black beans after rinsing them well. Then a can of tomato sauce. I let that cook on low for a bit while I thought about the fact that more needed to go into it.

So I had some chopped baby bellas. Threw those in there. I have a lot of kale-- and my only regret with this is that I didn't rip it into smaller pieces. I'm new at kale. It's pretty tough. I chopped up 5 potatoes and threw those in there and turned up the heat for a while. I recently was doing reno on my kitchen so I don't even know where half my spices are. I used pepper... no salt, surprisingly. I overdo salt all the time. I love salt. Salt is the salt of the earth.

So anyway, I let it cook most of the evening. I kept tasting it. It was kinda bitter. So I added some sugar (like gramma used to do). Then I added more sugar. Then it was better. I grabbed myself a cup of the stuff to try. Omg the sauce was sauce, but everything else was awesome. I didn't think I'd like it so damn much. I think I can do this!

Ever since then I‚Äôve been suffering from SIBO which is incredibly difficult to treat.

The issue with the diets people recommend for SIBO is that it excludes most carbs and lots of fiber. So rule out legumes, grains, fruits, and a bunch of vegetables.

I‚Äôd never not be vegan it‚Äôs really not an option especially 10 years in. Meat is repulsive. Idk how I‚Äôm supposed to restrict my diet even further trying to treat SIBO.

‚Äú you know you‚Äôre the one ruining the planet with your vegan diet‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy do you have to eat so weird‚Äù
‚ÄúVegan food is gross‚Äù
‚ÄúCome have some of this [insert non vegan food item here] it‚Äôs vegan I swear‚Äù


*Waves food in my face* ‚Äúmmm bet you miss this‚Äù
‚ÄúWhen are you going to eat real food‚Äù
‚ÄúThey were made for food, it doesn‚Äôt matter what happened to them‚Äù
*they tell everyone I‚Äôm vegan and then later on mention the stereotype of vegans always telling everyone they‚Äôre vegan*
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not even a big deal‚Äù 

*they like to try and get into arguments with me when I‚Äôm trying to avoid talking about veganism because I‚Äôm tired of having to defend myself*
‚ÄúYou‚Äôll understand real life when you‚Äôre older‚Äù
‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre a real adult you‚Äôll think differently‚Äù 

*they also constantly ask why vegans make vegan products to resemble animal products, I‚Äôve answered this a ton (we don‚Äôt object to the flavour, we object to the cruelty and killing of living beings) but at this point they‚Äôre just asking because they think it makes vegans look dumb*

* they also constantly talk about how I must miss meat, or cheese or any other non vegan food product* 
*they also love to tell me how I‚Äôm not really vegan because of mistakes I‚Äôve made (I know this isn‚Äôt true)*
‚ÄúVeganism is a choice, being keto isn‚Äôt (they‚Äôre keto, I just find this one very laughable though haha)‚Äù 
‚Äú you must not like us anymore because you never eat supper with us‚Äù 
‚ÄúPeople are just too sensitive about these things now days‚Äù
*they are also think that vegan products shouldn‚Äôt use words like milk, burger, sausage, butter cheese, etc which is ridiculous* 


There‚Äôs about a million more things they say and do but I‚Äôm blanking. I guess I shouldn‚Äôt be surprised about my dad and stepmoms behaviour. They seem to think vegans, environmentalist, liberals, etc are all dumb and just need to grow up and be real adults.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18293883

Most recent studies using more sensitive techniques for detecting B12 deficiency have found that 68% of vegetarians and 83% of vegans are B12 deficient, compared to just 5% of omnivores. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12816782 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10966896 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10552882

On paper, calcium intake is similar in vegetarians and omnivores (probably because both eat dairy products), but is much lower in vegans, who are often deficient. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21139125 http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/70/3/543s.full

Vegetarians and omnivores have similar levels of serum iron, but levels of ferritin‚Äîthe long-term storage form of iron‚Äîare lower in vegetarians than in omnivores. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24871479

Fruits and Vegetables https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12064344

This is significant, because ferritin depletion is the first stage of iron deficiency. Moreover, although vegetarians often have similar iron intakes to omnivores on paper, it is more common for vegetarians (and particularly vegans) to be iron deficient. For example, this study of 75 vegan women in Germany found that 40% of them were iron deficient, despite average iron intakes that were above the recommended daily allowance. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14988640 http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/3/633S.long

many plant foods that contain zinc also contain phytate, which inhibits zinc absorption. Vegetarian diets tend to reduce zinc absorption by about 35% compared with omniovorous diet. http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/3/633S.long

Thus, even when the diet meets or exceeds the RDA for zinc, deficiency may still occur. One study suggested that vegetarians may require up to 50% more zinc than omnivores for this reason. http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/3/633S.long

It turned out exactly as you'd expect- vegan junk food and ice cream, concern about protein, subtle jabs at vegans (""guess this means I'm a better person than you now!""), comments about how vegan meat substitutes are gross, etc.

The YouTuber concluded that it was not as hard as they thought (even said it was fun)... But now they're back to paying for the murder of animals.

??? 
I know it's for entertainment and for clickbait but really?? They literally admitted that it was pretty easy to be vegan and that it was fun but now they're back to supporting cruelty? And pretty much ALL of these challenge videos are full of misinformation, jokes that poke fun at vegans, paranoia about protein, and so on. I don't think that any of this actually convinces viewers to try, especially since most of these people instantly go back to eating animals.


I just wish people would not turn the idea that we should live without exploiting others into a silly challenge or game that you can quit after seven days. It really makes me sad ‚òπÔ∏è

349,Beginning to go Vegan,"It really sucks, nobody I know is vegan or even vegetarian. I'm not doing this for animals or for humans. I decided to just go against the big meat industries that are polluting and destroying the environment. 

I'm not doing this for me, and I know my own impact isn't going to fix anything. It's the principal of the matter. But why is it so ridiculously difficult to get support or even know people that practice this. I'm in Texas (USA) if that helps. There is some options and I'm doing fine, but the social separation I've gotten from friends is ridiculous. It's also costing me a little more than I'm used to and I'm poor.

I'm still going to keep at this. Not for me, but for the principal of protesting environmental damage. I just wish it wasn't socially and financially straining.

357,Mild Parent Success,"I'm almost 40 and visited my folks who live across the country. This was my second time visiting since going vegan. 

We had a big dinner with my vegan meatballs and everyone loved it. They were much more understanding and open minded than my visit last year. 

The next day my parents asked about vegetarianism. I explained the dairy industry is worse, with the extra layer of cruelty on top of all the cruelty of the meat industry. I asked them why a cow produces milk, what happens to their babies, how do they stay pregnant, and much like myself, my parents said they had never even thought about that at all, and actually seemed affected by what I said!

That night I managed to talk them into watching an Earthling Ed video, the one where he gives a 30 minute talk to a classroom. The next morning my Dad said he's getting more and more convinced, and would actually cut out meat. My parents were forwarding the video to their friends.

A few days later I watched What the Health with my mom. She was so into it, following along, being shocked as the realisations hit her, just as it did with me. After the movie, she was writing emails to her friends about it. Over the next few days I would hear my mom talking to other family members about the movie, reciting certain moments. It actually gave me this warm feeling inside.

I'm back in Seattle, and yesterday my Dad sent me an email saying he has been good about cutting out meat, but dairy is just difficult because it's in so many foods. It's ok to me that he's made that one step. My parents are pretty old. He also told me he's proud of me, and I don't know about any of you but that's something I don't hear. I'm proud of him too.

Thanks for reading. Today's been a shitty day, and thinking of this helps me feel better. I know family is the hardest to deal with when it comes to veganism, but it's possible to get a bit of understanding and compromise. Good luck.",vegan,BimmyLee,1570000292,7,True,2019-10-02

370,"Red and processed meat are OK to eat, controversial new guidelines claim - DEBUNKED.","Honestly tired of the reporting. Did no one fact-check this study?

A recent study was published by Annals of Internal Medicine. I usually don't even look at pro-meat studies because they are easily debunked (usually funded by the meat industry, glaring methodology problems, not factoring in additional variables, etc), but this one is a meta study of four studies, which are themselves meta-studies of 100+ studies each. It's being reported left and right so I want to address it.

The goal of the post is to dissect this study and (hopefully) debunk its claims. Hopefully to get ahead of the media's reporting on it. 

[Link to the paper here](https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2752328/unprocessed-red-meat-processed-meat-consumption-dietary-guideline-recommendations-from)

##The recommendation.

What most media outlets focus on is the recommendation itself.

Their recommendation is as follows:

&gt;For adults 18 years of age or older, we suggest continuing current processed meat consumption (weak recommendation, low-certainty evidence). Again, 11 of 14 panel members voted for a continuation of current processed meat consumption, and 3 voted for a weak recommendation to reduce processed meat consumption.

Why make this recommendation based on low-certainty evidence? 

##Evidence

&gt;we found low- to very low-certainty evidence that diets lower in unprocessed red meat may have little or no effect on the risk for major cardiometabolic outcomes and cancer mortality and incidence.

The evidence for this is from a meta-study with 0 citations that was published *the same day* and was authored by the same people. They hand-picked studies funded by Meat and Livestock, Australian Pork, ad National Cattlemen's Beef Association. So although *this* study wasn't founded by any party, it uses a study that uses studies that *did*. Pretty scummy IMO. 

Unless I missed something when reviewing that article, it seems they completely cherry picked the data as well. Of the 13190 records they screened, where they identified they have no duplicates - they picked a mere 1507 for no explainable reason. Then they took those 1507 and cut them down to 24 because they didn't fit the design of the study. So out of 13190, they took 24 studies that confirmed their bias. That's 0.1%. **Talk about cherry picking data.**

##Conclusion

This post got really long, and I've only addressed one line in their article. But it's clearly BS. Almost **ALL** of their sources are meta-studies they themselves had written with 0 citations that were published on the same day. Having looked at a few of them, it's very clear they grossly misrepresented the data to fit an agenda, and have hidden behind the term meta-analysis.",vegan,KinOfMany,1570010936,0,True,2019-10-02

And do not grieve the unsuspecting birds by taking eggs; for injustice is the worst of crimes. And spare the honey which the bees get industriously from the flowers of fragrant plants; For they did not store it that it might belong to others, Nor did they gather it for bounty and gifts. I washed my hands of all this; and wish that I Perceived my way before my hair went gray!""**

I wasn‚Äôt surprised of course, but a bit annoyed. I corrected them and said no dairy. For some reason I was given fish the next day.

I was given celery, carrots and cucumbers with a vegetable juice box. That was it. Same thing the day after.

I live in a medium sized city where there are a growing, yet small amount of vegan friendly restaurants and food stores. I've been trying to find out the tools I can use to find these places easier and I stumbled upon HappyCow which this community seems to swear by.

Have you used HappyCow? Do you really like it?

I've personally find it extremely unsettling that it is the only vegan-friendly restaurant finder on the market, as the design of it very poor, its clunky, cheaply-made, and ultimately I've not found it to be too much more helpful than Yelp or Google reviews.

I was out for drinks with a friend and found some delicious Seitan Wings on their menu, nowhere to be found on HappyCow.

Also I find it interesting that HappyCow is not specifically catered to vegans, and instead vegetarians AND vegans, even though we stand by very different principles.

423,Not doing enough as a vegan,"So I've been vegan for over 2 years now and about a year after I first went vegan, I started watching some vegan youtubers and joined a few local vegan communities to keep learning more about the industries as well as the health benefits of being on a vegan diet. At first when I began watching these channels and going to these events, things seemed pretty civil (e.g. they would just explain facts about the industries or scientific studies and highlight why it is important to be vegan). It definitely seemed great in comparison to some of the extreme, and arguably aggressive, vegan youtube channels that I had seen previously. However, I've noticed that some of these channels that I've been watching have been becoming more similar to the latter. I no longer feel welcome in the community as it keeps being reiterated to me by these channels (as well as some vegans I have met in real life) that I am not doing enough for the movement because I'm not involved in activism. A handful of vegans I have met in my personal life have told me that I may as well not be vegan if I'm not going to help out in activism. 

When I first went vegan I did try to help out in activism, whenever people in my personal life would try to debunk or criticise veganism I would argue back with facts, and I joined the committee of my university's vegan society to create artwork for activism. But then my physical health started to get in the way, and as a result I was struggling with my university work, I became too fatigued to spend time doing hobbies, and I stopped trying to defend myself when people criticised veganism or criticised me for being vegan. I couldn't bear to go to animal rights marches because my social anxiety became exacerbated by my health problems. I no longer had energy to create the artwork for my university's vegan society, and if I'm honest, I never enjoyed doing it in the first place. I love to create conceptual and meaningful artwork but the ideas aren't something which can be forced. A lot of the pieces I paint are much more related to personal struggles because art has always served a therapeutic purpose for me, and having to keep trying so hard to come up with inventive ways to get a message across for vegan artwork killed the fun of painting for me. I'm not sure what I should do anymore. Even though health wise I'm not particularly in a good position to be pushing myself to do more for activism, other vegans keep telling me that I'm not doing enough, that being vegan isn't enough and that I should be prioritising fighting for these animals' rights.",vegan,MisfitAntoinette,1570029529,8,True,2019-10-02

12,Just broke up with my bf because he's not open to veganism :(,"He declared to me that it's most likely never going to happen. I've been struggling with his meat eating for our whole relationship. I really tried to accept him and his decisions but at the very heart of it, it made me extremely sad and disappointed to continue to watch him participate in the violence. 


I tried to rationalize by reminding myself that he really does eat less meat than most people. That was true. He cared about me and my beliefs but said he knew about the animal agriculture industry and he didn't care enough to change his diet. That was the most upsetting. I think I really believed that anyone who knew the horrors of the animals' lives or the environmental impact could not continue to participate in good conscience.  In the end, I could never count on him to be able to support me or understand how I feel during the times where I feel utterly alone and defeated.

31,Shepherding Nature and The Vegan Obligation,"It seems to me that the ethical underpinning of veganism is ultimately to reduce animal suffering. This is done in two ways
1. by reducing animal product intake we reduce the demand for farmed animals and thus less animals live in these farming conditions
2. by reducing the amount of animal farms we reduce their negative impact on the climate which impacts all life to some degree

given these statements I wonder if when we are at the point of near ubiquitious veganism across the globe have we fulfilled our goal of ending animal suffering? or have we only ended suffering from our hand? are we further obligated to tame nature, or do we turn a blind eye to its ravagings? if we could genetically modify wolves to eat grass instead of deer is that morally obligated from a vegan perpsective? if we could employ drones to administer vaccines to the animal population is that obligated as well? is the ultimate goal to extend the same quality of life we expect for ourselves to all residents of the planet or should we simply strive to have a non-negative impact?",vegan,mynameisaugust,1567278071,2,True,2019-08-31

46,Want to Help Me Convince Ranchers/Animal Industry Workers to Farm Plants Instead? Add Your Ideas (free of grumpiness),"The idea is to reach out and bring together people that know how to, or will learn to, clean toxic land (I have some insight on specific fungi being able to restore toxic ground), recycle/repurpose animal industry machinery, train employees to farm plants in an eco-friendly way, and have donators/investors to pay for all of it (I'm sure I'm missing necessary steps) so they can make either just as much, or more, profit with this business.  This is going to take help from all kinds of minds-- vegan &amp;&amp; not yet vegan-- because everyone has perspective, ideas, creativity, and many talents despite their food choices.  


The money will be donated to them after a solid, formal contract is signed to use that money only for the transition to farm healthy plants and no more animals.  Even though it seems counteractive to help animal ranchers raise more money, I think it's the best plan to encourage them to change their minds which is where real, lasting change comes in.  Ranchers/Animal farmers invested a lot of their time and energy to build and run these farms, and I've noticed that taking any stance ""against"" them and yelling at them to go vegan isn't making the most respectful difference.

50,"For people with excessive bloating and gas, try this.","Beano, or digestive enzymes in general. 

I've been vegan for almost a year now and I fluctuate from being whole food to junk food pretty frequently. Whenever I went whole food vegan I would have bloating, constipation, gas, and a large amount of undigested food in my toilet. I would also have no energy despite getting enough calories and nutrients but would constantly be craving oily, fatty foods. 

Then I started taking beano. Instant difference. Instead of feeling uncomfortable after eating a big bowl of rice and lentils, I'd feel energized! My junk food cravings almost vanished overnight. Now I take [these](https://www.amazon.com/Source-Naturals-Bio-Aligned-Supplement-Constipation/dp/B0009EXOUA/ref=asc_df_B0009EXOUA/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=312075031577&amp;hvpos=1o2&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=2181867731000225910&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=m&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9061124&amp;hvtargid=pla-597938774084&amp;psc=1) and my life has been completely altered! Regular bowel movements, better sleep, better mood, no bloating, healthy amounts of gas. Overall I'm amazing now!

From what I can tell, I was eating so much junk food during my life that my microbiome was out of whack and I didn't have the digestive enzymes to break down large amounts of high fiber foods. I know the gut bacteria adapt over time but during that transition period it was absolute hell on my body and I couldn't sustain it for more than a month or so without needing to break for junk food. 

I'm hoping I can stop taking these within a couple of months once my bacteria are up to par, but for the first time in a while I feel like I can actually be healthy for good this time around! So dont give up and see if this works for you!

63,Vegan for 3 years + trouble with weight gain,"I'm sure variations of this question have been asked before, but I couldn't find anything that exactly addressed my situation. So I'm going to try my luck and ask you guys for suggestions &amp; reassurance.

I've been vegan since mid-2016, but was on/off since the end of 2014 (my diet was fully plant-based except for yogurt, which was really hard for me to stop eating). Prior to going vegan, I grew up lacto-vegetarian (no eggs) and I drank a lot of whole milk, ate A LOT of yogurt, had a moderate amount of cheese. So, when I switched to a vegan diet, I lost ~11 lb (5 kg), but this also coincided with me getting lazy about strength-training regularly. 

I'm 27, currently weigh 88.6 lb (40.27 kg), and am 5 ft tall. I'm perfectly healthy &amp; I'm not deficient in anything (based on my bloodwork and also the fact that I rarely fall sick). I do come from a culture though where being on the fatter side is equated with being healthy - and I've definitely absorbed some of that thinking. I'm also worried that not being heavier might turn out to be a health issue as I get older (though I have no data to back this up except horror stories that my parents tell me lol). 

So, my question for you is are there any vegan foods I can eat to gain weight easily (I want to go back to ~100 lb for starters.). I'm honestly not too inclined to start strength-training now, but I run &amp; dance regularly (5-6 times a week). 

I try to eat mostly whole grains, beans, and a lot of vegetables/fruits and some nuts. I try to stay away from packaged/canned food as much as I can. So, recommendations in these categories will be greatly appreciated.",vegan,klutzy_but_cute,1567288619,10,True,2019-08-31

99,A Vegan who doesn‚Äôt love animals or pets. (Unpopular opinion),"I have never been fond of pets. I‚Äôve always seen them as more of a hassle and responsibility than a joy to own.  You have to clean up their poo, they leave hair everywhere, they are noisy, less rental options, you can‚Äôt go away on holidays sometimes etc.. I also think that all animals should be free in the wild. The idea of owning animals and it not being able to run free disturbs me. I can understand where it stemmed from, dogs probably hung around humans for food and care, but could run off and do whatever they want. But now that we live in a world where it‚Äôs illegal for pets to be free to roam, and we mostly live in concrete jungles or suburbs, it just feels wrong. I think we should have left animals alone. In my perfect world, you‚Äôd have massive areas of untouched land wear animals can continue the circle of life and so can the ecosystem. And then cities could live in a walled off self sustainable area. And if we wanted to explore the outerlands where animals and the environment live undisturbed, we could go hiking or tours but we couldn‚Äôt live there or cut down trees or kill animals. Honestly the world‚Äôs corporations are clearing way to much land for us, did you know that you can fit 7 billion people in Texas comfortably? I read that statistic online, you could leave the entire world untouched except for one large state, but we use too much land on resource heavy unsustainable efforts. 
Anyway I‚Äôll stop talking about the ethics. You could say that the annoying things about pets can be applied to children. However children learn and grow, you see them develop into hard working kind hearted people (hopefully) instead of this furry thing that drains money and time and will never change. I look forward to having children because there is a payoff, one day I‚Äôll be able to sit them down and give them advice, help them get their first job, tease them about their first crush, care for them when they are sick and hope they‚Äôll do the same when I‚Äôm old etc. Pets can‚Äôt do that. And if you feel like you need love from an animal, maybe you‚Äôre just afraid of putting yourself out there and being loved by a creature that can love you on the same level: a human.

104,"What are your standards when it comes to purchasing products?

I feel this way about buying things like oat milk from Quaker Oats brand, because most of their oatmeals aren‚Äôt even vegan (literally the silliest flavors will have milk in them for no reason). I think it‚Äôs better to give your money to a company mainly comprising of vegan options, because that‚Äôs supporting a business that is doing something besides capitalizing off of veganism. 

I think this applies to clothing too; why give your money to a company like urban outfitters, who‚Äôs products actually contain things like leather and wool? Even if the product you buy is vegan, you‚Äôre giving your money to a company that is in support of leather.

108,Can veganism legally be a religion? (Serious),"I might get some backlash from this from people who may not understand my reasoning, but I'll try to be clear.

This is about social security. Something people who are in their ..possibly 40's(?) down to my age bracket (early 20's), and younger may or may not actually receive when they've fulfilled their contract so to speak.

Social security is not a savings account that you're able to deposit and withdraw from at will. It's a withholding that you'll see on each paycheck, that's about 7% of your check, and you likely will not see 100% (maybe 60-80% from what I understand) - and it's paid to you in allotments, opposed to being paid out in one lump sum.

If you're like me, you're vegan for the animals, but you also view your diet as a sort of health insurance; insuring that you'll be able-bodied well into old age granted good lifestyle choices. Now some might say life is a gamble, and that social security acts as a safety net in case something bad happens to you, but I'm of the mindset that I'd rather take my chances, and keep that 7% of my money ..since I may or may not see it in the future anyway, I can follow the advice of ""save 10% of your money (and maybe invest it)"" with much more ease.

Social security cards used to say something along the lines of ""not to be used for identification."" The social security cards we know today, that's not the case. It's everything for our identification. At the bottom of this post, I'll share a link to a quick, to the point little animated video that briefly explains how social security came to be what it is today.

If you watch the video below, you might have the same question as myself if you're interested in this topic: Can veganism technically qualify as a religion, granted its longevity and universally peaceful nature?

Veganism has existed for ages, hiding in all corners of the world; always seeking to shed light on the darker, harsher realities of the social contracts in life that many don't ever dare question. Some even suggest that Leonardo da Vinci may have been vegan, or possibly vegetarian (which would no doubt have been the equivalent of veganism in his time).

Now, understand that I'm not trying to paint veganism in a negative light by suggesting that it is subjectively a religion. This is something that people come to their own conclusions about with their own beliefs. Many of us to my knowledge identify more so as agnostic, athiest, or perhaps practice spirituality of some nature. What I'm suggesting is that many of us could potentially benefit on a legal scale by using the religious protections that may exist if veganism was an optional religious belief system. It's not hard to draw the conclusion that veganism could qualify under the legal definitions.

So, I pass the question off to you:
Whether you're for or against the thought of veganism being portrayed as a religion, what are your thoughts? What if there were religious protections for people who live in areas that are hostile, or descriminant against vegans?

116,Is it paradoxical?,"Most people in the world are roughly morally equal. Even though veganism seems to be moral baseline if you think of it in logical terms, it sadly seems that culture is more important for determining morals (in most people) than logic and reason and even compassion.

But I wouldn't go so far as to say the people that eat the meat and animal products are all bad people. Some of them actually sacrifice more time and energy than I think I'd even be willing to...for example, meat-eating veterinarians who work extra hours to perform emergency surgeries on animals...i don't think I could do that...and yet they're unwilling to make the small little sacrifice of going without animal products for every meal to save animals from needless easily preventable death. Isn't that...strange? People will do e everything in their power to avoid having to euthanize a terminally I'll pet, but won't suffer without taste to save hundreds of animals. 

Also, vegans all have family whom they love who aren't vegan. And I don't think it's accurate to just make excuses for all these people, just saying that they must not be vegucated. This is the 21st century. I'm pretty sure most people know farmed animals don't live blissful lives and that there's no such thing as humane slaughter. It seems sort of unfair when people say those who know of the wrongs and don't change are worse than those who are supposedly unaware of the wrongs and also don't change, because I don't believe anyone really is unaware of these wrongs, or if they are, it's likely because they have made effort bury the truth.

Still, even though they aren't bad people, how can you not want to rage at people for being the cause of the slaughter and the pain? You can't love animals and eat them too...really. but people honestly are masters of compartmentalizing all the conflicting thoughts and behaviors they have. I guess I am one of those people since I morally agree with veganism but haven't gone all the way.

I want to know how you can change people...how? Are people like us who think about these things just the unlucky few who were cursed with empathy for animals that seems to get us nowhere? It just seems like no matter what we say, people will always be angry at vegans.

As a person who hasn't gone all the way myself, I know it's wrong but I just feel like changing will only result in me dying having sacrificed more taste and convenience just so devout carnis can say ""I'll just eat more steak to get back at vegans."" You know what I'm saying? I'm not trying to justify myself but I just wish I could feel more convinced to change cuz i want vegan friends but selfishness gets in the way

Yeah, it's easy to say that going all the way is easy, but I know a lot of vegans had a long journey and it wasn't just overnight for everyone...and if even devour carnis aren't Hitler, than a 1% carni isn't Hitler either, right? Is it really right to say that a person who only eats meat once a week is the same as a person who only murders once a week? I feel the answer to that is yes AND no...because it just seems more complex than that. However I still don't think eating meat is ever truly morally justifiable (besides in poverty situations or when nutritious vegan food is unavailable).

222,I'm back ;),"Earlier this week I had made a post saying that I was no longer going to be vegan and instead be vegetarian due to matters involving money, convenience, time, and my social life. However, what I did not disclose was the fact that I had been influenced by a very malicious crowd, known as carnivores. I had begun watching videos of ex-vegans and videos where a man named Goatis (s3vrige or something like that) would react to vegan's ""what i eat in a day"" and justify how unhealthy they were due to their diets being filled with things such as ""anti-nutrients"", sugar, and lies due to him suspecting that vegans constantly craved animal products. As someone who has had a history with disordered eating, I began to constantly have his propaganda and information tormenting me in the back of my mind. I began to believe him when he said that all vegans are ""delusional"" and unhealthy as a result of their eating habits. I do not blame Goatis completely for my choices, but they did influence my decisions. Consequently, I began to toy around with the idea of being a vegetarian due to personal choices such as being excluded in social events, not being able to afford expensive vegan convenience foods, for the convenience of it, and for wanting to feel less lethargic and sluggish. Despite my intentions to commit to something more convenient and better for my lifestyle I only made things worse. After watching so many ex-vegan videos I kind of began to believe that maybe a vegan diet isn't suitable for EVERYONE as everyone has different needs, and so I thought that maybe eating yogurt and eggs again would make me feel better without doing so much harm to the animals, and satisfy my desire to live a more social life with friends and family. Now, this is where my life took a toll for the worst, but also taught me the importance of accepting mistakes and learning from them. To start off, the moment I ate yogurt (Greek and normal yogurt) I felt awful. My stomach was all over the place, and being the type of person who hates using public restrooms I felt terrible at school and could not control my stomach pains. I thought I would get used to it, but between the 3 days I had dairy I knew the pain wasn't worth it. Now, what really motivated me to continue being vegan was the moment I ate eggs. I had cooked some eggs and ate them on toast, and the familiar experience and taste had put me into a state of shock. I wanted to cry, throw up, and flip the table. I was overwhelmed with so many emotions as a result of me realizing how terrible I was and felt. For the whole day, I felt awful, both emotionally and physically. Both my mind and body were telling me that this isn't the way to go. It didn't take much more contemplation for me to realize that eating animal products isn't worth it. I never realized how amazing I actually felt as a vegan. For lack of a better word, I felt *clean* as a vegan. The moment I ate the eggs I felt quite *dirty* and knew that what I was doing was wrong. The rest of that terrible day was spent with me doing research on how equally terrible the egg and dairy industry are compared to the meat industry, and I have now realized the type of person I want to be in life. In short, I am back to being a vegan, for the long-haul. However, I do ask for some advice from all of you fellow vegans, such as how to make cooking less time-consuming, how to handle social situations when eating out with friends and family, and how to get all the iron, protein, and DHA  I need as a vegan.

i'm not here to completely bash on omnis. i'm a new vegan myself! i have respect for omnis who do at least small things, like purchasing plant milk instead of cow milk. these little things make differences. when i was an omni i did these things too, because i knew i was making a difference! i am thankful that people are slowly learning and making these small changes, even if they are not fully willing to go vegan. but i had to rant a bit!",vegan,beariesad,1567367731,4,True,2019-09-01

270,Passive Marketing and Spending of Your Vegan Money at Corporate Fast Food Restaurants is Contributing to the Increase in Meat Consumption and Leading to the Death of More Animals,"I know this is a very hot topic at the moment and I'm guaranteed to piss a lot of people off, so before you down vote, please hear me out.

**TLDR: by passively marketing for and spending money at unethical fast food companies, you are giving them more customers, driving the sale of meat products and increasing profits to be used in furthering the suffering of animals.**

Business Insider recently published an article discussing an increase in sales of BEEF Whoppers, due to the release and popularity of the Impossible Whopper. Yes you heard that right. [You can read the article here](https://www.businessinsider.com/impossible-whopper-boosts-burger-king-sales-2019-9). This news comes to light the same year as the USDA's report showing meat consumption on the rise in the United States.

I see no reason not to assume that meat sales have also increased for other unethical fast food corporations like KFC, due to their vegan targeted marketing campaign.

I know there is an urge among a lot of vegans to one day be able to fully participate in mainstream consumerist culture. But we can not trust or rely on corporations to make ethical decisions regarding animal welfare, especially when the suffering of animals is a commodity and completely tied to capitalism.

There was a time I believed that our community was much smarter then this. It's inherent in veganism to question the actions of these companies and how they market to us. We do this every single day. Every time you see an advertisement from the dairy industry or when you go shopping and look at the ingredients on the back of a box. If you are vegan long enough it becomes second nature.

So why is it that this all goes out the window when corporations like Burger King, KFC and Impossible Foods offer up new marketing campaigns directly aimed at our dollars? It's just post after post of community members doing the marketing work for these terrible companies, recruiting friends and strangers to give their dollars, dollars that will be used to commodify more animals.

Sure, if given the choice I'd rather have someone that was going to buy a burger, choose a vegan version. But if you are vegan, and you give Burger King or KFC your money, you are not doing any animal a favor. It isn't activism and you are contributing to the problem. You have a responsibility as a vegan to do what is in your means to limit the suffering of animals.

I'm sure someone will leave a comment regarding my privilege or purist ideals or something of that nature (go to way of trying to shut down dialog). For context, I've been vegan for 18 years. Long enough to remember there being no vegan restaurants. I grew up in poverty, have been homeless, and squatted for many years. There were times I had to dumpster for food or starve. During much of those difficult times I still held strong to my ideals. There is a responsibility that we have when taking on the ideals of veganism.

One of the most consistent epidemiological associations between diet and human disease risk is the impact of red meat consumption (beef, pork, and lamb, particularly in processed forms).

The population-based prospective Cohort of Swedish Men (COSM) included 37 035 men, aged 45-79 y, with no history of HF, ischemic heart disease, or cancer at baseline. Meat consumption was assessed with a self-administered questionnaire in 1997. During a mean follow-up of 11.8 y, 2891 incidences and 266 deaths from HF were ascertained. Consumption of processed meat was statistically significant positively associated with risk of HF in both age- and multivariable-adjusted models. Men who consumed ‚â•75 g/d processed meat compared to those who consumed &lt;25 g/d had a 1.28 (95% CI: 1.10-1.48, P-trend=0.01) higher risk of HF incidence and 2.43 (95% CI: 1.52-3.88, P-trend&lt;0.001) higher risk of HF mortality.

There was no convincing lack of association between saturated fat and CHD mortality (1.15, 0.97 to 1.36; P=0.10). For trans fats, one to six prospective cohort studies for each association were pooled (two to seven comparisons with 12‚Äâ942-230‚Äâ135 participants). Total trans fat intake was associated with all cause mortality (1.34, 1.16 to 1.56), CHD mortality (1.28, 1.09 to 1.50), and total CHD (1.21, 1.10 to 1.33) but not ischemic stroke (1.07, 0.88 to 1.28) or type 2 diabetes (1.10, 0.95 to 1.27). Industrial, but not ruminant, trans fats were associated with CHD mortality (1.18 (1.04 to 1.33) v 1.01 (0.71 to 1.43)) and CHD (1.42 (1.05 to 1.92) v 0.93 (0.73 to 1.18)). Ruminant trans-palmitoleic acid was inversely associated with type 2 diabetes (0.58, 0.46 to 0.74). The certainty of associations between saturated fat and all outcomes was ‚Äúvery low.‚Äù The certainty of associations of trans fat with CHD outcomes was ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù and ‚Äúvery low‚Äù to ‚Äúlow‚Äù for other associations. https://www.bmj.com/content/351/bmj.h3978/




Myocardial infarction in red meat consumption by Oxford study Red meat consumption was significantly positively associated with ferritin concentrations and MI risk [HR per 50 g daily intake: 1.18 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.33)], but no significant associations with stroke risk and CVD mortality were observed. While direct associations between ferritin concentrations and MI risk as well as CVD mortality were significant in age- and sex-adjusted Cox regression models, these associations were substantially attenuated and no longer significant after multivariable adjustment for classical CVD risk factors. Strikingly, ferritin concentrations were positively associated with a majority of classical CVD risk factors (age, male sex, alcohol intake, obesity, inflammation, and lower education). https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-abstract/107/1/113/4763681?redirectedFrom=fulltext

306,Can't be vegan,"I've been plant based for a few months now, and ""mostly"" vegan (on/off, mostly on) for nearly 2 years and I am going to give up. Originally I wanted to just go vegetarian, but I became lactose intolerant at the start as well and I don't really like eggs that much so I was essentially vegan with a little cheese and meat in between. I'm not an animal activist by any means but I thought cows and pigs and chickens are cute and I wanted to be healthy which were my two main reasons. However it is a challenge to balance it right and I keep feeling weak. I supplement vitamin d and take soy milk fortified with b12. Upon reviewing my bloodwork I noticed some things were off, my blood sugar is within normal range but higher than it was before (in the 90s now, before 81). And my blood pressure increased from 100/67 to 112/74. Also my creatine levels were low, iron was ok. I did notice how much lean muscle I lost and it feels like my body fat % went up. I tried to eat as healthy as possible, get fortified soy milk, grains (I admit mostly white rice, but whole wheat bread and quinoa), tofu, veggies, and a some beans/peanuts - can't eat too much because it gives me gas and bloating. Ultimately I feel like I am weak a lot and now I'm noticing my hair is a bit more brittle and dry too. I'm guessing it's because I don't eat enough calories, protein, or fat. I relied on carbs and not enough protein. I'm a college student surviving on dining hall food or budget groceries at walmart and don't have time to plan around all these things. It's very hard to maintain in the long term. I realize if I was left in the wild to fend for myself I would end up hunting an animal at some point. Yes I ""like"" animals and would prefer to not eat them, if I wasn't lactose intolerant I would settle as a vegetarian and just eat cheese and drink milk. but I also see them as food in the end and can't handle planning a balanced vegan diet right now",vegan,forestsandunicorns,1567405575,22,True,2019-09-02

309,Single and young vegans. PLEASE READ!,"
My fellow vegans, especially those of you who are single and young, do not get into a serious relationship based on a vegan bond, however strong it is. Even if you want to, make sure they have been vegan/vegetarian for a VERY long time (almost their entire life). I learnt this the hard way and I do not want this to happen to anyone. Especially to those who are strict about only dating vegans/vegetarians. 

My wife was the staunchest vegan I have ever known. I met her in the New Zealand vegan dating group three years ago. Few years after adopting the vegan lifestyle in 2013, she started experiencing gut illnesses. A month ago, she was convinced that plants &amp; carbs were the culprits for her poor gut health after doing tons of research and wanted to stray from veganism. I objected first due to the strong bond we had due to veganism.  After a few discussions, my love and care took over and I told her I'd be okay with whatever she eats as long as she is healthy and happy. She tried dairy and eggs first. There was improvement but not as much as she hoped for.

She saw a doctor and he said her gut health was pretty poor and that she was pretty close to Chron's Disease. The doctor told her to eat mostly animal based foods such as meat, eggs and dairy. Apparently, fiber makes her guts flare up. Even though veganism was the sole foundation of our relationship and that I haven't eaten meat or eggs my whole life, I was prepared to have a marriage where one member is a hardcore omni. But things changed for the worse and everything went downhill. 

She started doing research about ex-vegans and she started turning to the dark side by the day. When I met her, she used to debate with everyone that humans were herbivores/frugivores. Now she is convinced humans are OBLIGATE CARNIVORES. The body apparently needs animal cholesterol to function and plants are 100% detrimental to human health. (It gets worse)

Everyday, I was waking up to her shoving ""credible research"" about pro-meat/anti-vegan studies in my face. Apparently some study showed that vegans have more brain shrinkage over time as opposed to omnis. She kept pestering me to eat meat otherwise I'd go retarded. She shared another research that stated it's technically impossible to be vegan because when you're on a plant-based diet, your body eats on your muscles due to lack of animal protein (It gets worse).

Through a video, she arrived at a conclusion that even herbivores aren't herbivores and they start eating animals due to lack of animal protein. She said it's graphic so I am scared to watch it. If someone has the stomach to watch animal violence, please go ahead and opine on it in the comments:  

https://youtu.be/TdTXaFtDqZE

Oh yes, it still gets worse. As per her research, plants apparently release toxins when they are harvested. These toxins are detrimental for the human body's immune system and can lead to depression, heart disease etc. Whenever I joyfully shared a pic of what I was eating at work, she always scorned at it because it was plant-based and full of toxins. It came to a point where I put my foot down and told her to not impose her omni lifestyle on me in a ""You do you"" way. I also reminded her that when she was vegan, she told me she would leave me instantly if I quit veganism and that it's extremely unfair to change me into the very thing she hated once. Her reply to all of this was ""Fine. I refuse to cook toxins for you from now on"". I keep telling her I have been vegetarian all my life and the farthest I can go is consume dairy from a legit happy cow farm.

We used to feed ducks. Now she eats ducks. Her omni parents were gonna slaughter and eat a rescued chicken in 2018. She cried that it was gonna die so I went out of my way to find a rescue shelter via this group and made her happy. Now she eats chickens and tells me to eat them cuz I am not a cow but a lion, an obligate carnivore. ""Don't be a deluded vegan hippie"" she said. She did petty things like change my name to ""Angry Vegan"" on her phone. The same person who used to share Gary's best speech with her omni friends and family started using the ""circle of life"" argument and claimed she'd even go as far as hunting animals instead of supporting factory farming.  I didn't know who my wife was anymore. We decided to get separated few days ago. I gave it all I had to save this marriage. I really tried but everything was devolving.

Depression runs in my family, I've been clinically depressed since I was a teenager but it seems that no matter how much I try to keep my depression in check, my mood is always brought down whenever I'm reminded of animal cruely or when I see people hating on vegans online. No amount of anti-depressents or healthy living can ever stop me getting depressed about animal cruelty. 

I've been vegan for almost 7 years, and I'm tired of people picking arguments with me whenever they find out I'm vegan. I just don't get what their problem is? I never bring up my veganism unless it's relevant, I try to avoid the topic because talking about veganism just makes me sad. I remember in school the new girl used to offer me snacks in history class and they'd never be vegan and I had to keep saying ""No thanks, I'm good""  for weeks because I didn't want to sound obnoxious by telling her I wouldn't eat her food because I'm vegan. But people in school would still claim that I was preachy and never stopped talking about veganism, when I'd only talk about it if they asked about it. 

I know it sounds dramatic, but I sometimes get so disturbed at the thought of the amount of animals being abused for food, cosmetics, clothing etc, that I think about killing myself because I don't see how I can ever be happy in a world that justifies this amount of senseless cruelty.

330,"AITA for ""converting"" my brother (11m) and myself (f17) to veganism? (r/vegan edition)","hello kind people of reddit,

i had a heated discussion with my parents yesterday and need some outside view on it. hope it's fine if i post here instead or r/aita because i don't think they would be too understanding about a kid x veganism.

some background info: I turned 95% vegan when I was 8-9 (I basically ate 1 sausage every 2 months) and stopped completely when I turned 13-14. Around a 1,5 years ago (when i ~15) I stopped drinking milk and replaced it with soy/oat milk. I also reduced all my other dairy/egg intake over the months. for the past months my breakfasts, the food I take to school and my dinner have been 100% vegan - but not lunch (which is something my mum makes. it usually includes milk, sometimes eggs).

I took a blood test around 2 months ago and my doc was ""devastated"" about my diet *ugh*.
she said I have to eat fish/meat 2x a week with dairy/eggs everyday (I have a b12/vit d deficiency at the moment). my parents - who have been really sceptical about vegans/vegetarians obviously used the results to blame me and to talk bad about me (check post history for some info). but my stance is that I prefer taking pills over supporting mass murder and rape. I can't imagine myself drinking milk or eating meat ever again. it's just wrong.

my brother (now 11), who watched documentaries in school talked to me about vegetarianism 1-1,5 years ago and after explaining my stance he decided to go vegetarian. my parents have been blaming me since then even though I never forced it onto him and always said it's his choice. he was the one curious about it.

well, I joined a really nice german vegan server which supported me and gave me food ideas for lunch for the past days (classes got cancelled so I had time) so I have been fully vegan for 5 days. I made rice with veggies, baked veggies&amp;potatoes, adapted more fruits to my breakfast etc.

yesterday I was trying out another recipe and my brother decided to tune in and help. We spent 4-5 hours together, prepping food, talking and: watching vids.

I showed him a ""I went vegan for 30 days"" vid, vids about veganism and we watched some gaming clips.
I dont know why. I thought he'd be interested since he is so open about it. we discussed it etc. He completely agreed but I told him not to talk about my parents about to it and to just continue his life as before (I knew they'd be furious). I suggested to him that he may try out my vegan yoghurt next time or to  that we could visit a vegan restaurant nearby (he wanted us to) and he seemed very hyped about it.

well, he is a kid. and he told them. he was sad about our soap being labelled ""milk and honey"" and enthusiastically told my parents about vegan butter which was more cheap. he told them all kinds of things in his little hype. what a cute little lad.

well my parents were furious (my dad way more than my mum), he called me and started screaming. he was about to explode and slammed the desk really bad. he called me selfish and horrible and said I dont decide about my diet until I turn 18 (in march).
He told me veganism is horribly unhealthy and I will suffer longterm effects from it and that it's a stupid trend. He threatened me with all kinds of punishments (taking my phone/pc) but I was the most scared about him hitting me (happens but very rarely).
the thing he was the most furious about was that I was ""converting"" my brother and forcing him into veganism. he said my brother will lack all kinds of vitamins and that he NEEDS milk&amp;egg since he is growing up. I know that this is NOT true but I also know that I won't be able to change his mind.

now I also know that my parents are just really worried about their son and I will talk to my brother about veganism today. I hope we can stick to the compromise I gave him yesterday. he continues his diet but tries out my vegan yoghurt or liverwurst from time to time. I hope if I do this I'll be allowed to stay on my vegan journey.
my parents will not care about facts or studies or anything. they are talking based on emotions.
in addition, my doc recommends an omnivore diet (-_-) and a health consultant.

was it wrong of me to show him 1-2 non graphic vids and talk to him about it? he was genuinely curious.
am I really that selfish? Does he need a non-vegan diet? he barely ate veggies&amp;fruits before but I told him that he needs them so he has been eating them more and more lately. what do I do now?

I am currently in school and I *do not* want to go home. If he forces milk onto me I will refuse and rather starve. Yesterday I wasn't able to express my thoughts but I feel like I fucked up.
Should I just have kept quiet?

I don't know what to do.

357,What are your best tips for going vegan?,"Hello everyone! 

Recently I decided to start the journey towards becoming vegan and it's something I've attempted or considered before but would eventually find myself incredibly daunted at the thought of starting, and was also in a place with my family where I was living on their food and diets. Now I buy my own groceries and would like to move towards being healthier, and also living better! 

I know the mechanics of how to go vegan and already I eat mostly vegetarian but I still eat chicken. I've never been a fan of red meat in that way but already I've been sometimes at a loss when I look in the fridge to think about what to make for dinner! But I want to change that! 

I'm wondering if you guys had any helpful tips that can make the transition easier/make the cravings for meat less! Or what sneaky things to watch out for as well! Just yesterday I realised that I had to be more careful when buying sweet treats because I need to find alternatives for dairy and small things like that! I've gone on YouTube to learn about making meals and on how to feel full but it's still a rather daunting switch to make!

I'm also finding it hard to go outside with friends now! Recently when I was out with friends to celebrate a birthday, none of the meals were vegan and the only vegetarian option was an appetizer! I've never been a big eater but I still felt a little gypped because of it. 

I just want to get ahead of this lifestyle change and thought some help/pointers would be really useful and let me become vegan in a successful healthy way!",vegan,nikki8195,1567435663,17,True,2019-09-02

In fact, the fishing industry is just as bad. 

So if their money is still contributing to the problem, what really is the point? To say it‚Äôs for health reasons seems invalid, because dairy products are still bad, so it seems pointless to not just go all-in and be vegan. 

Whenever it‚Äôs come up that I‚Äôm vegan, I immediately get the ‚Äúoh well I‚Äôm vegetarian!‚Äù It‚Äôs almost just as bad as the ‚ÄúI could NEVER give up meat!‚Äù, or (my favorite) ‚ÄúI barely eat meat‚Äù. 
Vegetarian and vegan are on a different spectrum. Vegetarians could waltz on into any Wendy‚Äôs and stuff their faces with a Wendy‚Äôs salad that‚Äôs smothered in cheese and ranch. The only connecting factor is not eating meat. I don‚Äôt think they realize how different it is to live a vegan lifestyle.

368,I realized my favourite pasta salad recipe is vegan!,"I have been trying to eat completely vegan since last january and just now realized that one of my all time favorite recipes is vegan, so I thought I would share. This has pretty much been my go to meal prep recipe for years because it's so simple to make and doesn't need any fancy ingredients, but is still super delicious. You need: 


-cherry tomatoes (about 500g) 
-one cucumber 
-2 cloves of garlic 
-black olives 
-500g pasta (I like the ones that look like clambs for this one because the stuff gets trapped in them, but you can use whatever...maybe not spaghetti) 
-fresh basil and chives (you can also use parsley) 
-olive oil 
-aceto balsamico (if you don't have access to a vegan option, you can use any vegan vinegar just adapt it so it doesn't get too sour)
-salt and pepper


1. While the water is heating up for the pasta you can chop tomatoes, cucumber and black olives into small pieces. Put into bowl. 
2. Put the two peeled garlic cloves together with the pasta into the boiling, salted water. Cook until al dente. It's ok if they still have some bite, it's better than if they are too soft! 
3. Mix olive oil and aceto together. I do half half, but the quantity depends on how much pasta I use. Add some salt and pepper. 
4. Chop the fresh herbs. 
5. When the pasta is ready separate it with a colander from the water. Then you can find the two garlic cloves that should now be soft from cooking and press them into the sauce. Add the still warm pasta to the cut veggies, add the chopped herbs and then pour in the sauce. Mix well and thats it! 


It's super good when it's still warm, but I actually like it  best when it's been in the fridge for a day! I hope this recipe will serve some of you the same way it has served me for many years. Enjoy!",vegan,mywallsaredirty,1567440763,2,True,2019-09-02

She‚Äôs almost 8 and very adamantly does not want to eat animals- her dad and I are vegan, her mom is a former vegan (now pescatarian I think?) but is still making her eat chicken and turkey and such at her house, despite not eating it herself. Upsetting, but out of our jurisdiction. So we just keep our diet here and don‚Äôt talk about what she‚Äôs made to eat there unless she wants to talk about it. She wants to be vegan here, (she‚Äôs mostly vegan here already for the past 3 ish years) but still occasionally has snacks with dairy. The older she gets the more passionate about it she becomes! 

Issues we‚Äôre running into- aside from the other parents house/family, her peers are often kind of weird or rude about her not wanting to eat animals.

440,Serious question (to me anyway): biofuels based in part on animal fat,"Hi folks, here is a serious question, at least in my mind: we all know that petro fuels can be seriously bad for the environment.  Many people become vegans for almost the same reason that other people switch to taking the bus or riding a bike instead of driving a car: to reduce environmental impact.  

But what about this?  Suppose we could all switch to biologically-sourced fuels for our cars, trucks, or whatever, BUT ALSO suppose that this biofuel had some animal-based content to it?  

I'm referring to one type of biodiesel that is looking more and more viable as a replacement for petroleum diesel -- similar energy content, but without the potential to wreck rubber hoses and fittings and eat fuel filters -- and that is actually commercially available in increasing quantities.  In addition, they say it is more stable and actually usable in cold climates.  This fuel is called R99, and it's made from a mixture of vegetable oils and animal fats.  

The ethics of biofuels are complicated.  Ideally, vegetable oils would be recycled so as to not impact food availability.  In addition, vegetable-based oils result from plant production, and plants are generally good for the atmosphere.  But animal fat-based fuel?  Or even partially based on animal fats?  

If we quit eating animals (in part) to avoid bad environmental impacts, but it turns out that ONE PART of the animal results in good environmental impacts, does that make it more OK?  What about people (like myself) who consider themselves ethical vegans?  I don't wear any leather because buying leather is part of the economic process of killing animals.  What about driving my work truck using oil that is obtained from the same animals that I didn't want to be killed in the last sentence when it came to my choice of footwear?  

I would love to hear some perspectives, and I'm hoping this may help me figure out how I feel about this.  In the meantime, a couple of interesting links:

443,Raising chickens as a vegan? (Strange situation),"Hello! I was wondering if there is anyone else caring for a chicken or chickens as a vegan. About 2 months ago, a chicken showed up at my house and I never put out an ad for her because I didn't want to potentially give her back to someone that would harm her. She's been eating the tomatoes and cucumbers I've been throwing out from my garden (she's an awesome gardening buddy!) and I've honestly become a little attached to her. I want to get her a proper coop to roost in at night and a heating lamp before it gets really cold here. My question is, is there anything I could feed her to slow down egg production? I've been looking at food for her and most seem to be geared towards increasing egg production. We do not eat eggs and I plan on feeding them back to her as a treat. She appears to be fairly young and currently roosts in one of our trees. She only stays in our yard and has become accustomed to my husband and I and have started running towards us for food. I worry about predators (we have coyotes and she could get run over by a car if she goes too close to the road) but I think for now, she's going to remain free ranged. Any other chicken raising tips will be appreciated!",vegan,meowkiteh,1567467139,10,True,2019-09-02

481,Carnivore here. Want to try again vegan just for science.,"&amp;#x200B;

I eat mostly raw meat, and eggs, from well raised free animals, or grass fed. I also eat occasionally fruits, and very rarely some rice. And thats it. My body does not tolerate anything else.

Everytime i tried a vegan diet my health deteriorated. I believe veganism is good only for some people, and in some situations.

I always lost muscle mass, energy, and got depression. Thats what i can attribute to the lack of animal products in my diet.

But i also got allergic reactions to most vegetables, grains and some fruits. Fruits are good for the most. As for those other issues i dont necessarily blame veganism for it.

So it seems people like me have no other choice than eating meat, if not at least seasonally. But still i want to try it one more time, to see the effect will be the same.

The reason why i want to try it again, is because in the past when i did juicing for a few days, i felt some benefits. But i dont think that can be attributed to veganism, but the fact i was fasting for the most.

However, since i dont tolerate most vegetables. I can only eat rice, and fruits, because everything else will cause terrible symptoms in the short term and illness in the long term. I think that is quite restrictive. But ill see what happens just for a few days.

I would like to know if any of you are as restricted as this? And if you are tell me how have you been doing. Do you work out? How do you feel?",vegan,TheLastMgtow,1567495788,41,True,2019-09-03

Some turn vegan but most end up justifying it and if they make us vegans look bad, they can feel good about doing their immoral acts. Deep inside they know what they're doing is wrong that's why they're so mad at us and like to make fun of us. So don't let these people tear you down, guys. We have that cognitive dissonance and weight off our shoulders. We can look at animals and love them without somewhere in our subconscious feeling guilt and shame about how we actually treat them.
Whenever you get backlash from meat eaters just pity their narrow minded brains and unwillingness to change. Their laziness and selfishness.

I need some meal ideas that won't draw too much attention (sounds bad I know) but I have a nearly 3 year old who quite often only eats the meat on his plate and leaves the rest and has only just started eating one unprocessed vegetable very recently which is carrot. I also have my partner who is not particularly compassionate when it comes to animals, he doesn't want to inflict unnecessary pain (as far as a meat eater can say that) but he doesn't like them even when they're alive, he thinks they're smelly and stupid. And then there's me who really wants to make the change but I always run out of steam a few weeks in.

I'm looking for meals that aren't noticablely lacking in meat, I'm not a fan of fake meats or things that are there as a replacement. So far I can only think of vegetable soups and stews, jacket potatoes and meat free pasta bakes, does anyone have any other ideas?

Oh and one more awkward thing we're not a fan of Mexican food, when I've asked for meal ideas on Reddit before a lot of Americans answer and you guys love your Mexican food lol. We don't eat a lot of Mexican food in England so we don't have a lot of options in the supermarkets and I don't know how to cook that kind of thing, I've tried before but it didn't taste nice, maybe it's just me or maybe we just don't like Mexican, I'm not sure.

490,Question to my Vegan Friends about my Vegan Children's Book.,"Hey Vegan Fam. So I just created a vegan children's book because I noticed so many books talk about meat and animal products like its no big deal. I published with amazon who doesn't have a vegan category for children and I couldn't  list it under cook book categories. The best thing I could think about was to put a vegan logo on the cover which is also the logo to my vegan website. Hopefully that will let vegans know that this book is vegan friendly. Has anyone else had this experience, and do you think it will be enough to get the attention of Vegan readers? Anyway I apologise if this is posted in the wrong section, I didn't know where else to post it. I am giving my ebook away for free on amazon until Thursday, if you want to read it and give me some feedback I would greatly appreciate it. I know the art is a bit amateurish because I am a beginner, but I am already working on my 2nd vegan book and my art is improving greatly. If you are interested in reading it for free on the kindle, here is the amazon link.

498,Today is My Second Veganniversary!,"Two years ago today, after thinking and learning about veganism for years, I took the plunge and have never looked back. Then 50 and diabetic, I made the move for health reasons, in a fit of pique over frustration with my physical well-being. Since that time, owing in no small part to this beautiful community, my heart has grown ever more tender for animals and their well-being and my environmentalism, a long and sustaining commitment, has deepened and broadened.

So two years later, the results have been life-giving and fulfilling. Countless animals have been allowed to live, death-centered industries and enterprises have not been supported, acres have not been cleared and have remained forested. And my health has substantially improved: my diabetes is under much better control than it was before, and I have been able to stop taking all three diabetes pills I used to take. Still insulin-dependent, although that has reduced significantly, above and beyond stopping those pills.

On this anniversary, I commit to increasing my efforts to spread veganism and its ideals and principles and the facts which support it, which are legion. I commit to stepping up my efforts to improve my own health, with the goal of increasing my significant weight loss in hope of becoming ever less diabetic. My body needs that! 

And I commit to reaching within and opening up and being in touch with my feelings, both in the positive and the negative. Owning pain and acknowledging it, embracing love, sharing and celebrating it. And ever being open to learning and expanding awareness and understanding. Thank you, vegan friends, for so kindly and beautifully helping me along this path so often. ‚ù§Ô∏èüå±‚òÄÔ∏è",vegan,WeHaSaulFan,1567506283,4,True,2019-09-03
