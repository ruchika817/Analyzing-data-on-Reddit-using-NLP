0,Misinformed and Misleading Vegans,"[I don’t eat animals]
It’s speculated that we evolved because we Did eat animals. Otherwise we’d still be up in the trees and we wouldn’t be here sharing our lifestyles with strangers on the Internet. I’m a vegetarian but I know that animals DO get killed in the clearing of land used to grow our crops. Vegans lie and say that’s only for grain farms to feed live stock but they Are lying. I’m a vegetarian but honestly it’s WAY BETTER FOR THE PLANET if we actually grew our own food. Otherwise you ARE supporting animal death. How many bugs and small animals died to grow our vegetables and fruits? I don’t know the exact number but if you say none... you’re lying. If you wanna start growing your own veggies I highly recommend the kratkey method of hydroponics. It uses less water and no electricity is necessary (you can just put it in front of a window). I do recommend getting some LED grow lights, though (you don’t need fancy ones). And I’d just like to add that you shouldn’t just people who hunt for food because guess what... they’re not relying on factory farms and it’s not bad for the environment (climate change is a result of a large population which relies on large scale production and agriculture). A good hunter is smart enough to not go after endangered species because they know they’ll be hungry tomorrow and they deserve to eat just as much as anyone else does. Most vegans rely on commercial agriculture which, again, kills animals. Growing your own food, growing what you want and need, will lead to less waste of all our natural resources. So don’t say you’re a vegan if you contribute to the death of animals by what you put in your mouth! Genuine veganism is much deeper and more difficult than vegans lead on. Just know that everyone with an agenda has just that, an agenda. Our planet is not designed to hold billions of people who constantly need to consume on such a large, greedy scale. Honestly, if you wanna save the planet, the best way to do it is for humans to come together and not make any babies even just for a year, until we can solve some of these very pressing issues which threaten all those babies futures anyway. It’s simple logic.

I posted this in a comment on Instagram, but I know it’s too important to share to not be seen. I hope this will be seen and people will be more properly informed about their impact.",vegan,commie4u,1577742251,0,True,2019-12-30
1,Is eating road kill meat ethical?,"So I was listening to a radio program while driving. They had a former vegan on who currently lives in Alaska. She reintroduced meat into her diet because where she lives, road kill of (moose and deer) are salvaged for human consumption.

People place their names on a list and are contacted when an animal is killed roadside. Said people drive out to the location to salvage the meat.

The argument is that letting the meat go to waste is unethical. The animal is not harmed intentionally and the meat does not go to waste. The flip side was that respect for the animal should be considered regardless.

I found the debate interesting and wondered what this communities thoughts were on the subject.

4,Bad start,"Whenever I think back on this I cringe. In about 2 weeks I'll be celebrating a year as a vegetarian. A few months after vegetarianism I started towards veganism by cutting out milk and cheese and slowly but surely have worked up to full vegan. 

But before I went vege I decided I'd have a ""last hurrah"" and went to a BBQ place with friends and loaded up on meat because I'd "" miss it"". A big part of my decision was I knew how poorly they treated animals before they ..you know killed them. And yet in my head just one more meal couldn't hurt. No idea what I was thinking and I look back on myself like a different person. 

Anyway my point is I know a lot of people are probably considering going vegan in the new year and are maybe going to think like me. My advise is don't do it. Rather than that spend your money by going and trying a really nice vegan restaurant instead and celebrate your new life.",vegan,sierra117x,1577743051,3,True,2019-12-30

20,Vegan Pregnancy - bad teeth,"I've been vegan for a few years, and recently had a baby boy. He's 10 months old now, and has yellow patches on the 4 teeth that have come through. 

It actually looks like a section of the enamel itself is missing. I'll be taking him to the dentist next week, but from what I've researched on the internet I'm pretty sure it's a condition called enamel hypoplasia. 

I've been down a rabbit-hole researching this, and it's lead me to vitamin K2. It's important for teeth development, and although the body can convert some K1 (found in veggies) to K2 (found in animal products), it seems like scientists are starting to doubt the efficiency of that. The research seems pretty new - K2 was only discovered in 2007 or something. 

I was diligent in planning all the usual nutritients you hear about - B12, D, calcium, etc. Buy I just hadn't heard or thought about K2.

Has anyone else experienced this? I have found other similar stories elsewhere but I don't know how representative it is. Or, anyone who was vegan throughout pregnancy whose kids have great teeth? I'm looking for some kind of confirmation or alternatively reassurance here.",vegan,OkMany1,1577747657,6,True,2019-12-30
22,My Vitamin &amp; Mineral Supplements research during vegan pregnancy,"My girlfriend and I are expecting a baby in February. Once I found out we were pregnant one of the first things I did was spend a night researching which vitamins and nutrients are important to make sure she and the baby have enough of these.
Generally we eat very healthy, almost completely organic, but still it is hard to get things such as B12 or Omega Acids from plants only, so wanted to be on the safe side and supplement to the daily minimum dose.
Below is a list of what my midnight hours on the internet returned in condensed form. 
In short my GF and our baby are doing great, and the doctor that is accompanying us during the pregnancy has stated that everything important is covered. Many people told me I should post this information somewhere so here it is.
If it is of interest I can link two three shops in Germany where vegan supplements are available, for example vegan Omega 3 capsules which was tough to find. (We tried oils first but didn't like the aftertaste) Just let me know...  (I have no affiliation with any shops whatsoever and am in no way being paid or receiving discounts etc. for this.)

Thought it might help others get started. I am NOT a health professional so please confirm this with your doctor and consider this basic information to start with only.


Phatty Acids
-  Omega 3 Acids from EPA and DHA saturated oils or capsules (200 mgDHA/day, essential for mother and child) 

Vitamins
- Vitamin B12 (10-50 ug per day)
- Vitamin B6 
- Vitamin B2 
- Folic acid (400 ug per day, ideally also before pregnancy)
- Vitamin A
- Vitamin C
- Vitamin D3 (20 ug/800ie per day) 

Minerals
- Iron
- Iodine (100-150 ug per day)
- Zink
- Magnesium
- Calcium

We've been taking Chlorella Tablets (B Vitamins) and and Marine Calcium tablets as they include a lot of trace minerals on top. 

The source of the recommended minimum doses etc. was the German PETA site which was a great starting point for us: https://www.peta.de/gesundemama

31,I’m slipping,"Hi y’all, just here for some encouragement.  I started eating Vegan around June of this year, and as of recently, I’ve been staring at all the food I used to love and just feeling empty inside.  Not like spiritually empty, but physically empty.  I noticed when I first started eating Vegan, I would feel full, but never satiated.  This leads me to eat all day long, but I never feel “full” even though my stomach feels full. This, mixed with some cravings has caused me to break on just a couple occasions and eat cheese.  Since I’ve gone vegan, these are the things I’ve had that have animal products.  

Two bites of Pizza Hut cheesy crust in October. 

A sliver of smoked salmon in November

Mashed potatoes with butter in them at Thanksgiving.

A full babybel cheese (this is my most egregious, because I thought about eating for a full hour before hand and I was in a very low place.  

A slice of cake at a party.  

And most recently, a slice of cheese pizza with all the cheese peeled off.  


I feel bad, I really do, but my plan is to go 100% in the new year.  I feel like I’ve cut myself too much slack, and each time (except for the babybel) my mishap was brought on by social pressure.  I’m familiar with the term Freegan, and part of me wonders if that’s a better choice for me, but I’m also sort of an all or nothing person, and the thought of hurting a sweet cow any more than I have in my life hurts me.  I guess partially, I needed to get this off my chest, but if anyone has been through something similar to what I’m going through in the transition period, I would love to hear your stories.  And if anyone has any new and unique foods that fill voids left behind by animal products, I’m all ears.  

I just want to go out and say this, I won’t be responding to angry or condescending comments.  If you say I’m not a Vegan, that’s fine, but not constructive.  I’m here for encouragement and thoughtful conversation, not hate.",vegan,Allan_add_username,1577752726,16,True,2019-12-30

46,Waking Up: Life on a Small 'Humane' Farm,"*You cannot carry passengers on a smallholding. This is what I had been told. I didn't like it but I believed it to be true. Everything has to earn its keep.* 

*Be strong.* 

*Onion had his head chopped off... we ate him*

&amp;#x200B;

Vicky Hamill's childhood love of animals inspired her move to a smallholding in the wilds of Orkney. Initially she had some chickens and a goat but, unable to refuse any animal that needed her help, she quickly found herself tending a motley collection of sheep, cows, goats and geese on her small 'humane' farm.

But farm animals have a defined life cycle. In this memoir, Vicky recounts the conflict between her attachment to her animals and the demands of farming. She vividly recalls the joys of feeding newborn lambs and the despair of killing them, joyous and heartbreaking moments that eventually led her to quit the farm and become a vegan.

Exquisitely narrated and deeply moving, this is a book for anyone who questions the morality of the food on their plate. It doesn't preach but it convincingly tells the story of one woman's journey towards awareness.

I I’ve just been lazy switching to vegan as cooking vegan food has (maybe incorrectly) seemed more difficult, and finding options at restaurants seems more difficult. 

I watched  [The Game Changers on Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/watch/81157840) yesterday which was super interesting, it talks about the benefits athletes have seen when going vegan. And it’s produced by Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jackie Chan, Arnie has got to know what he’s talking about 😂

It also talks about the inflammatory effects of animal foods, so I’m keen to see if a vegan diet could help with some knee and shoulder issues I’ve been having.  

The doc mentions how 3 weeks is how long it takes to see some effects, so I (and my girlfriend and a friend) figured Jan 2020 would be a good month to try go fully vegan and see how we feel. 

Plus, if I do en up going fully vegan now it will be an easy date to remember when I tell my grandkids about it in 50 years 🤓

I find acrylic to be inconsistent as far as texture goes, especially since my previous yarn purchases have been Red Heart and the like because money. The best yarn I have ever used was alpaca (not purchased by me, and used before I went vegan), but obviously that is out of the question.

I'm interested in making items that feel more high-end without necessarily being insanely expensive. I'm basically looking to hone my craft more and make better-quality things that are cruelty-free. Sustainability is also a big deal, and acrylic doesn't really check that box. I haven't worked with a ton of different types of fiber because of cost issues. 

So here's my question: what materials do you guys use? I've heard bamboo yarn and hemp yarn are more sustainable, but how are they on cost and texture? Also, where do you get your yarn? I don't think my local craft stores will have that kind of thing so I'm curious as to where I can find more sustainable vegan yarn. I'm willing to pay a little more now that I'm older and have a better-paying job, so I really want to explore my options.

Do you avoid foods that have a horrible impact on the environment like palm oil (deforestation of the amazon rainforest and killing of orangutans, I've noticed a lot of vegan food contains palm oil), almonds, soy, etc.? Are you conscious of child and slave labour, as in, do you consume coffee and cocoa that isnt fair trade or buy things made in countries like china, Bangladesh, vietnam etc.? How do you get around? Car, bus, bike? Do you use plastic, including vegan leather, or do you go for plant fiber and other natural biodegradable fibre (plastic of any kind harms the planet which harms animals, for many many years)

214,Tomorrow is my 10 Year Veganniversary,"As the title suggests, tomorrow is my 10 year Veganniversary and I thought I'd celebrate with a few tips for anyone making the transition in a few years. 

1. Eat enough calories. Incorporate plenty of potatoes, grains/pasta/bread, beans, and nuts/seeds into your diet. If you are concerned about nutrients, it's easy to create a free account at [chronometer.com](https://chronometer.com) to track your nutrition. 
2. Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. You will never be able to reduce the amount of suffering caused by your consumption to zero. It's not a fun fact, but it is the truth. Make general rules and stick to them. Don't fret over every little minute additive in foods. 
3. Master one meal recipe at a time and have a few go-to meals at home.
4. TAKE A FUCKING  VITAMIN B12 SUPPLEMENT!  
5. Treat yo self occasionally. Becoming a vegan doesn't mean you're becoming a monk. (Unless you're literally becoming one of those Vietnamese vegan monks or something........) 
6. Don't let veganism become your entire identity. There are other important things in the world to fight for, strive towards, and create meaning in your life. Veganism doesn't solve every problem in life as some might have you believe.  Also, for some reason many vegans forget that humans are animals too and deserve to be free from exploitation, suffering, and abuse. 
7. If you're having trouble finding a vegan partner in your local community, the internet is your best friend. Use it. 
8. If you find yourself struggling or thinking about reverting, revisit the original reasons you went vegan in the first place. Re-watch a vegan documentary and get re-inspired somehow. 
9. It can be socially difficult to be a vegan. Anyone who tells you differently is not being honest. Try to develop the perspective that any struggles you have are sacrifices made on behalf of the animals/humans who would otherwise be harmed by your actions. 
10. If you are having health problems, see a physician. Veganism is not a cure-all. It can help prevent and treat many conditions but not everything.

216,Wind turbines are not vegan because they kill birds.

217,Opinion: Following a vegan diet is different than being a vegan,"I think most of us can agree the less animal products we consume the more we are making a difference. Following a vegan diet and purchasing a leather handbag is better than purchasing that bag while following omni diet. But... you’re still making a conscious decision to hurt an animal when you were 100% able to avoid doing so. That is not vegan, and if you do this, you are not vegan. I wish there was a bigger distinction between a vegan lifestyle and a vegan diet. I hear plant-based being used more and I think that’s great, but too many people are still confusing a plant-based diet with veganism or using them interchangeably. You don’t go vegan for your health or because you want to lose weight, you do it for the animals. 

I want to make it clear that I’m not trying to discourage or alienate anyone who doesn’t fit my definition of vegan. The animals would be so grateful to know you are leaving them off your plate and I hope you continue your journey. However, hearing things such as,  “my friend’s vegan but she does it for the health benefits,” and  “I’m vegan but I allow myself to cheat,” and “I’m mostly vegan,” etc. makes my blood boil because not only do these people not understand the difference between vegan and plant-based, but they are also spreading their misinformation. I think my frustration comes from the fear that veganism will be seen as another fad diet in a few years. That it will be dismissed as pseudoscience because of the “cure all” claims people are making. Thoughts?

I know a lot of vegans are against people exploiting/using animals in any way; from eating them all the way down to horse racing, animal testing etc. 

I’m just genuinely curious as to where guide dogs come in to this argument. Because obviously they provide an invaluable service to people less fortunate but it’s also a lifetime of working for a person, one where a dog is basically deprogrammed in to not being a dog.

Motorcycle gloves are a whole different ball-game though, the few non-leather options that used to exist are no longer around, and finding something that is decent for riding and will save my hands in the case of a crash is almost impossible. Thing like Mechanix Wear M-Pact are not designed or built for motorcycle safety, but people wear them anyway :-(

248,Transition to Vegan: not getting morning wood?,"I'd like to mention the following information of myself so you have a better understanding.

I'm a 28 years old male health/fitness freak. I'm extremely conscious with what I eat, I buy almost everything organic. The only thing I haven't been consuming for the past 10 years is cow milk but I do consume grass fed whey protein after my workouts. I work out 5-6 times a day with medium to heavy weights and good amount of cardio.  I take a lot of multivitamins and other natural vitamins.

Here's where everything changed:

When I saw the Netflix documentary called ""Game Changers"" it influenced me to stop eating meat. I told myself that I'll start cutting red meat ( I mostly eat organic elk, horse and bison) and stay with seafood and poultry. Now, it could be psychological but it's been a few weeks now that my sex drive has decreased. I'm not sure if it's because I cut the red meat. At the same time I tried NoFap to see how things would change but then I end up worry so I try to see if my stick ""still works"" by fapping but it doesn't feel as firm nor does it stay for long.

My diet changed drastically.. I rarely eat any animal meat, instead its mostly lentils, beans, a lot of complex carbohydrates. I feel like I lost strength and body mass because some of my clothes feel loose. I mostly got worried because I wake up with no morning wood!

1.) No more food coma for me. I thought having food coma was normal. Now I do not have any bloating problems and it is lovely.

2.)Better skin! I don't break out as much I did before.

3.) Dishes are easier to wash. Turns out getting animal products from pans were super hard. 

4.) Watching my nutrient. I mostly do this for other people when they ask where I get my protein (1st question I get when people find out I am Vegan). I tell them dark leafy green and legumes. They are normally skeptical until I flash them a screenshot of my cronometer. 

5.) My cooking improved and I am trying new, various ingredients. Previously, I would just stick with typical animal product with some veggies and rice/pasta. Now I have played around with different ingredients that I never even would have tried. I am discovering more and more foods that are so delicious. My fridge is looking like a garden and my grocery bills overall went down in price. Tofu is much cheaper than typical packaged meats.

6.) [I also did my best to be close to zero-waste]( https://imgur.com/OU0Mrd8). I went from 3.5 Earths to .9 Earth. I have not used a single plastic bag from stores, brought my own containers/bottles everywhere, started composting, got solar panels, and etc. 

7.) I rarely got sick this year compare to before.

393,My friends doesn't like veggies but got convinced that veganism (or at least vegetarianism) is the right step - how can I help?,"My best friend is a very rational and logical being. And while I usually am not trying to convince people to change their diet, with him it was an exception. It just bothered me how someone so critical in thinking can not see all that is wrong with eating meat, be it from an ethical, a health or environmental view point. 

So I tried and today sent him a video of EarthlingEd ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3u7hXpOm58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3u7hXpOm58)) and essentially his stance only 5min in became ""He is only saying things I agree with"" and that he is willing to give it a try but feels lost from a practicality point since he doesn't like veggies at all. So ""plant-based"" was just kind of scary in his mind so far.

I told him to watch the rest and practicality won't be the thing that's making his endeavor fail. Now I wanted to ask you guys for ideas / help how to approach this and to get a sanity check on how I would continue:

1) I want to sit down with him and talk it through. Which scenarios is he facing that he views potential problems with? What foods does he actually like (I think he's okay with lettuce, spinach, beans, lentils, potatoes, tomato sauce, chickpeas and carrots, so there is stuff to work with).? How much is he willing to cook himself? What does he currently usually eat and how can we simply veganize that?   
(Side note: ofc it would be cool if he could change his stance on veggie consumption and all that, but let's assume for the moment, this is not going to happen and too many changes at once won't be easier to handle, so let's work within that framework for now, ok?)

2) Ideally I'd like to recommend one of those 30 day programmes that cover step by step different things and make it less scary. Does anyone have good recommendations for that? I've done the one from PETA 2 and I saw the link on this sub to the vegan bootcamp. Any other recs?

3) He's not huge on cooking but for the dishes he does on a regular basis, I can walk him through veganize them since I am fairly good in all things kitchen related. 

Is there anything else you guys can think of that might help?

Also, this sounds like he is kind of lazy and doesn't do much thinking himself. That's not it. I'm pretty positive that it is just scary to realize how wrong your food choices are but you dislike most veggies. I'm really excited about helping him through this transition.

427,Vegan Omega 3 supplements-- price spreadsheet and Consumer Labs information,"Awhile back I did my research into Omega 3s and decided to supplement. Tired of the uncertainty, I finally paid Consumer Labs for a product report, and did some research on price, to try and find the best products out there.

When selecting a vegan omega-3 product, it is easy to find products high in ALA, but keep in mind ALA is not as useful to the body as DHA and EPA, and is converted rather inefficiently from ALA to those more useful forms (if I recall correctly, something like 1/5 to 1/3, but I did that research several months ago and have now forgotten.)

Here's my google spreadsheet on vegan Omega 3s, including price per pill, mg EPA/pill, mg DHA/pill, and total EPA+DHA/cent. 

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G8uG5lZ4JOFX_OPFyGSuJMuiFIZJ_SDeg7keozS42LM/edit?usp=sharing

It's not intended to be entirely comprehensive, but some products were obviously going to be more expensive for less content so I didn't bother adding them.

Let me know if you find better prices, or if the info is inaccurate. Also note the entire Consumer Labs Omega-3 report is linked in .PDF form. It's got a lot of info on things like medical applications for Omega-3s and dosing.

My findings: Ovega 3 is not only the best cost/pill and cost/amount of omegas, but also one of the brands that was tested on Consumer Labs and recommended. Deva came in second, and was also tested by Consumer Labs.

None of the others were tested.

Also note: NO algae-derived omega 3s are currently USP certified. USP is an international standardizing body that tests for accuracy of labeling, freedom from impurities, bioavailability, etc. 

Several are Good Manufacturing Process certified, which means they are likely to be consistent in terms of purity/availability/contamination/etc, but it's a lower standard than USP.",vegan,realvmouse,1577917710,14,True,2020-01-01

My parents are both omnivores, my dad couldn’t care either way about my diet but my mum says in principle she agrees with being vegan, but practically it’s unlikely to work out. 

I’ve decided to do veganuary this year with the aim of continuing with being vegan, but my mum isn’t happy about it. She says that it’s already hard and stressful enough to cater to my dietary needs without adding anything else, even though I make all my own meals, make a shopping list for ingredients, and pay my way in terms of shopping bills. I’ve even offered to do my part of the shopping myself, but she’s still unhappy about me wanting to be vegan.

465,Is there a hypocrisy on being pro-life and refusing to go vegan?,"So I constantly debate with someone about veganism and it always leads to the same conclusion with her. She thinks that human life is above all else. Humans are superior and more intelligent and have higher levels of consciousness. End of discussion. She refuses to go vegan because she doesnt see anything wrong with eating animals.  
But she's against abortion, doesnt matter if its a cluster of cells, doesnt matter if they dont co. (She had a baby at 19 years old when she had no place to stay, with a boyfriend that she despises, and no financial stability, THAT'S how much against abortion she is) I am personally pro-choice and vegan of course. It's not that I dont value human life, but I believe people should have the choice with what to do with their body and if they want to bring a child in this world (especially with climate change and overpopulation). I dont believe killing in the womb is the same as killing a conscious child who doesn't want to die.

So I feel like there's an hypocrisy in there somewhere that I can't quite grasp. She think its wrong to kill a human doesnt matter if its a mass of cells or 8 month old fetus, while paying for others to torture and murder other living sentient beings, Maybe its that the fetus is not as conscious/sentient/intelligent as the animals that we kill? (pigs are just as intelligent as 3 year old kid). The fetus doesn't consent just like the animals we kill don't consent to death. Is that it? I feel like I'm missing something.

I've searched the internet and some sources say that B12 is stored for years and that we don't need to really worry after only a few months others say we need to take it ASAP. Some say that eating breakfast cereal and non dairy milk often and the occasional vegan junk food is enough, others say that we really need supplements.

494,I’m going meatless (vegan) on Mondays.,"What’s up Vegan community?

My name is Morgan, I’m a professional athlete in the sport of Greco-Roman Wrestling. An amateur physiologist, and professional strength and conditioning coach. 

I’m no Vegan per-se. But have had my life’s experiences with a plant based diet. Over two years while competing and training led to some interesting adaptations which may have been favorable in other context, ultimately didn’t lead to my peak performance. Because of this,  in combination with the caloric deficits affecting my body weight, I returned to my omnivorous ways and found homeostasis.

Currently, I call myself a stay at home Vegan. This is because my fiancé is vegan and cooks most of the meals for us.  When eating eating anything of an animal product, I simply cook for myself. This extends out to the extra calories that I need in order to sustain my training load. (Upwards of 5,000 calories).

I decided to add some change to my diet in a new way.  So I decided to go completely vegan on Mondays.  I’m pretty stoked to go meatless on Monday’s. My fiancé, who is a die hard vegan, has great health, fitness and athleticism . She’s a perfect exemplar of a vegan success story.; it’s very inspiring.  While I could never claim the tribe, the sentiments, physiological(health/fitness), political, and environmental considerations and conversations which are created are valuable for all of society to understand.  All the while also showing that people they can incorporate and change an element of their diet with success, so they do it without having to have an “identity change.” Importantly, collective small actions make big changes. 

I’ll take notes and log about the marginal change in my Mondays and how it may make any changes to the overall picture of my performance, training, recovery and sleep. My Goal is to find the right balance in order to find which can help me improve my diet and performance the best.

So there you have it.

495,I'm having a hard time being consistently vegan.,"I decided to become vegan a year or so ago and remained consistent for only a couple of weeks. My parents understood and began to eat less meat and dairy themselves, but still told me that i should eat meat ocationally, and that being vegan was a type of extremism. They continued to put fish and cheese on my plate, and me, really loving these foods, ate them anyways. I have reduced the quantity of meat and dairy i consume almost to an 80%, and i have stopped eating cows meat completly. 

 I want to be completly vegan, since i totally agree on vegan principles, but the fact that i have a sort of cheese addiction, and my parents arent the most supportive (and yes i have had endless, well informed conversations with them, to the point where they agree with my points, just not my being a vegan), makes this really hard for me. I tried to make a new years resolution to stay vegan, but i broke it the first day, since my parents put some cheese out for breakfast and i just couldnt help eating some, and then a whole lot.

I feel like my recommended diet (related to my disease) is compatible... Low sugar, low salt, high potassium...

57,It's spreading!,"Sorry, I'm still new to this platform so I apologise for the potentially cancerous formatting!

I'm not even sure if this belongs here but I figured I'd post it anyway. 

I've been vegan for almost a year now and constantly catch flak about it from my co-workers. I'm not thin-skinned, but I'm just getting tired of the same boring old old jokes and the never-ending army of strawman arguments. 

Anyway, getting back on point! I have a client who must be in his 60s who has been coming to me for a few months. We'd chatted a lot while he's been in and out came up that I'm vegan. He showed an interest and asked a lot about what I eat ect. 

Fast forward to the appointment before last, he sits down in the chair and says:

Client: I'm actually looking for some information,and you're the man to talk to.

I was taken back because I didn't have a clue what he was referring to. It turned out that he and his wife had recently watched the documentary ""Game Changers"" and were in the middle of making their transition into veganism and were looking for places to eat in our city 😁

I, of course gave him my own full rundown based off a blog post I wrote months ago about vegan food in my city. I ended up writing down some of my favourite places on a card for him before he left that day. 

He came in again yesterday. Pleased to say he and his wife are making even more progress! He went out after his last appointment and went to one of the restaurants at the top of the list (top of the list was a place that did vegan and Omni dishes, cause their vegan food is banging but the place isn't too intimidating for people getting into it) but they were packed so they ended up going to the fully vegan place instead. 

On top of that he was also telling me about all the documentaries they've been watching including cowspiracy among others. 

He was even talking about how people have started treating him differently because of him going vegan (oddly refreshing to know it's not just me getting shit for it😂).

65,what is the harm in using animal by-products?,"yeah, yeah, yeah throw at me the definition of veganism all you want, but what i'm after is results. Will actions decrease or increase animal suffering? using by-products can make veganism much easier to practice without causing harm to animals (refined sugar is actually not vegan is made from bone char, a by-product of meat industry), I have a co-worker who quit veganism because of all the by products that she couldn't use (refined sugar be the most difficult one. she was also an idiot who said something about veganism was hard because she even got off the bus early to walk so she could lose weight and that she was initially reluctant to quit veganism because she didn't want to break her five year record.)

I want to have discussion about the harm in using animal by products and which ones are ok to use in our current time. For example, i would think that leather wouldnt be okay to use because leather is still an expensive item due to its history and cultural symbol, such that i could see people raising cows just for leather to use for expensive shoes and bags. However, I can also see things like beeswax and gelatin ok to use because their current appeal is that they are cheaper than vegan alternatives, which means that if we use beeswax and gelatin (that are used as part of products instead of the sole ingredient) while abstaining from meat, eggs, and dairy, it would eventually become nonsensical for businesses to use these ingredients because they would no longer be more affordable than vegan alternatives. thoughts?",vegan,LetsEndSuffering,1575195179,15,True,2019-12-01

And when I reply to my friends' Instagram story where he is eating salami pizza with a response ""Watch ""What The Health"" you might rethink your pizza life"". I get a response ""I'm immune to that vegetable propaganda"". 

There is so much information out there, I just don't know what to believe anymore. Sure, plant-based diet won't hurt you, but are these movies I've mentioned truly objective, or are they forcing you to believe that nothing that comes from animals will ever help you?

Early in the book the author talks about eating sushi with her friends from the aqaurium and proudly announces they didnt order the octopus, but they have no issue eating other fish?

Throughout the book she talks about how animals like Eels, sharks, lobsters, etc. feel pain, can sympathize, and have different moods, but she never condemns eating them, and later she quite blatantly defends aquariums' ""need"" to capture these animals in the wild and pull them out of thier natural environment and homes to show off to the public.  She even talks about getting a pet octopus, but only refrains because it would be hard on her husband. (Capturing thriving wild animals for your own amusement should be considered non-vegan right?) 

The books includes other things like forced mating of octopuses, death of captive animals caused by lack of planning but labeled ""unavoidable"", and the people in the book treated animals like paintings in a shitty muesuem to be traded and transported around in small containers (The book unapologetically describes an octopus being mailed in bag of water filled with its own excrament stuffed into an old tv box labeled ""RUSH"", but not labeled delicate or live animal).

130,"Question about Vegan “imitation foods” like Vegan cheese, meat, milk, etc","Hey all! 

I’m a newbie to Veganism - currently transitioning from an omni diet. I’ve probably got the same story as a lot of people as far as the transition goes - shame about my willful ignorance regarding factory farming, guilt about my environmental footprint as an omni, etc. 

Anyways, I’m happy to be making the transition now! I have a question that’s been weighing on me, though, and I’m hoping to ask it without coming across as offensive or ignorant, as that’s not my intent at all. Please forgive me for any mis-steps here! 

I’m curious about the environmental footprint of the Vegan “imitation” foods on the market that are created to mimic dairy and meat. I must admit that I’m loving the beyond burgers, but they’re super over-packaged and I find that quite disappointing. That’s caused me to also consider all of the production and processing that goes into creating these imitation products, as well. The products themselves can be really good - but with all of the packaging and processing, what is their environmental impact? 

I’ve seen a lot of conversation on the topic of the environmental cost of the meat and dairy industries, but does anyone know how the Vegan imitation food industry compares? 

Again, I mean no offence, so I’m very sorry if this comes across as offensive. I’m just curious about how I can move forward with my Vegan diet in a conscious and informed way - and with these industries growing so quickly, I do find some cause for concern.

1. I understand the power of green leaf plants and Brassicaceae plants, therefore I will incorporate a lot of those **(40%)** in my main meal diet;
2. Other plants like mushroom, ginger, onions, carrots, tomatoes, etc, would make (**30%**) of my main meal diet;
3. I also trim down refined carbs or carb with high Glycemic index in my main meal diet like rice and noodles, I will make these starch-based food (10%) in my main meal diet;
4. I love eating seafood and eggs (4-5 per day) so they would be (15%) in my main meal diet;
5. My family eats meat, but they believe similar theory I believe -- eat far more plants than meat, therefore the (5%) will be terrestrial animal meat in my main meal diet;
6. I don't like eating beans or Tofu, I know it's weird since I am Asian. I also dislike them and nuts because they are a hassle to deal with, they need to be processed to remove all the enzymes, oxalic acid, phytic acids or tannins. So they cannot be a part of my main meal diet.

I don't really eat much animal sourced products outside of my main meal,

I love eating fruits and avocado for after meal desserts:

I take some supplements:

Astaxanthin from Haematococcus pluvialis

Krill oil;

I think it’s because we don’t necessarily feel a need to seek alternatives. Eggs haven’t been a part of my diet in so long that aside from a spicy tofu scramble, I have no need for it. I have only bought the just egg twice because I don’t think I crave it enough to justify buying it.

289,"(TW talk about killing animals, basically) Opinions on eating hunted meat?","Hello! First time posting on r/vegan, and I'm not trying to cause any drama or controversy, rather have a friendly discussion about this. 

I would like to know what you people think of hunted meat (elk, deer) and fish (I kinda get this one bcs it's kind of disgusting to cause them to basically suffocate, unless you immediately get them out of the misery [bash their head, basically]) and eggs from self raised chicken, who I know had a good life in my back yard.

I personally hate the thought of farming animals for meat, the way they are treated is disgusting, but when it comes to hunting, I don't see it see it as bad since it is sort of the circle of life. In my personal opinion shooting and immediately killing a deer is much different from a wolf killing a deer for sustenance. Of course, I know people don't nessecary need the meat to survive, but we kind of anyways need to keep the animal population in control (maybe someone could elaborate if this is indeed he case, I'm assuming it is for the sake of the animals not getting in the way of humans, causing less car accidents and making sure they don't spread too near our living areas, causing more trouble for both humans and the animals) (also I don't believe in hunting for fun, like foxes and other animals might be), so why not utilize the meat. I know some vegans just find eating meat disgusting because is comes from another living being, but I kind of believe in the circle of life, if it's done in a way out of necessity. Fish is of course a little different since there isn't much nessecity for fishing, I'm assuming. I'm kind of on the edge about eating fish, maybe someone might be able to tip me either way?

About the free range chicken that YOU raised, I also believe in the fairness of eating their eggs, for I know they are treated well, and you might not have room to raise more chicken, so you anyways might have to disregard the eggs, again why not utilize it?

Again, this is all friendly discussion, I know this can easily get heated, so I just want your personal opinion, no judgement either way. 

Just to say, I'm also talking about elk for instance coming from a creditable source, like for instance I get mine from my father, who I know hunts for the nessecity of hunting, and provides the meat self butchered. Also I only eat it maybe once a month (or less), so it's a rare treat, in a way.",vegan,fitnesstuff,1575284560,2,True,2019-12-02

342,Visited my mother today and saw animals being mistreated,"Hi,

Today I visited my mother who's house is in an area with a lot of farmers that keep animals like cows, goats, sheep etc. While for the majority of the year when it's warm they're all outside, today I saw the conditions that some of the cows live in for months on end during the winter time of the year. I know not all of these farmers treat the animals they have this way, but to see how someone could treat these cows this way absolutely crushed me inside. I've seen it before in documentaries, and I've seen it before when I was younger. But how can someone think to themselves that treating another living being this way! The cows might not be beat or harmed physically, but the way that the are bound inside in FILTHY living conditions set to stand or cramply lie down in their own bowel movements. These animals shouldn't be treated this way. They shouldn't be bound inside in a awfully cramped space, with no way to move, dark, cold and dirty for months on end without any relief. They shouldn't be bound up like that for any period of time. I don't eat meat myself, but if we're going to accept eating meat as a society, we cannot allow for the animals that ultimately end up on someone's plate to live these kinds of lives. It hurts me deeply, to see another living creature being forced to suffer like that. It would be akin to putting someone constrained to their bed for months while they defecate and filthy themselves. 

Whoever takes ""care"" of these cows cannot have a conscience or see animals as anything other than objects to be used and discarded. It makes me sad, it makes me angry how doing this to animals is allowed by the law. I can think of a million ways to improve the living conditions of these cows! Although I personally object to keeping animals in any form for the purpose of using them in any form as a product, it saddens me that the laws that are supposed to protect the animal as an individual has no effect what so ever. It might not be economically sustainable for these farmers to invest in ways to ensure the animals are to every capacity able to live comfortable, healthy and enriching lives, but that doesn't excuse treating animals this way. If it's not economically sustainable for you to care for the animals under your house, then you shouldn't have taken on the responsibility in the first place. 

With all our riches, with all our resources we ought to make sure the animals that live under our care are actually taken care of! And I don't think there's any farmer in my country or any country that doesn't mistreat the animals under their care :/",vegan,poofyogpoof,1575306676,4,True,2019-12-02

Not to mention the fact that I’m very picky and lazy. I think the most ideal stuff would be cheap, easy to make meals. And hopefully some sweet treats, maybe vegan cake? I would love that.

398,Might I offer some insight from a newbie?,"I’m hesitant to post this since I’m VERY new to the vegan lifestyle, so let me preface this by saying I know I’m a rookie and I am not trying to offer any advice at all, but rather some insight to someone who is long past their “conversion moment.”

About six weeks ago, the documentary “The Game Changers” was recommended to me and I watched it. As a lifelong animal product consumer, I was immediately impacted by this film and have been cold turkey vegan ever since watching it. 

One of the biggest things I most appreciated about that film was it had barely anything to say about the animal rights side of things. It thoroughly convinced me purely from a health aspect. Everyone I have recommended it to has been impacted from it and almost every single one could care less about the animal rights argument to convert to plant products. Now since then, I have done a lot more research and my eyes have been opened to the major issues in the animal industries. I continue to research more and have growing convictions around topics of which I never gave a fleeting thought. 

So my point; trying to make a case about plant-based and vegan lifestyles from an animal rights point of view is not going to win the crowd en masse. 

Humans have a natural propensity to think “what’s in it for me?” If you can show them their personal benefit and how their bodies will be better for it before exposing them to the horrors of force fed geese, you’re going to win a lot more fans to the cause. 

Don’t mean to rant, just pointing out something I see as a baby vegan. Thanks for the resource this community is for someone like me. I look forward to growing with you all.",vegan,b_resh,1575324195,18,True,2019-12-02

To start, I'm not currently a vegan. One of my best friends throughout my life has always been one so I've always been around it. I've been thinking about moving towards it lately and am looking for some research on it.

I'm mostly curious about protein/calorie levels in vegan diets, as well as hormonal changes with high levels of soy intake or even just vegetable intake. I know these are some pretty highly debated topics, so tell me whatever you know about them, but I am mostly just looking for the research so I can read it over myself. I'm also really physically active, doing weightlifting, trail-running, and martial arts, so anything about that would be cool.

I have a background in biochemistry, I'm close to finishing my degree in it, so I've got a decent amount of background knowledge surrounding it, so I feel confident I can understand most of the research that would be presented on it.

If it means anything to you, the Netflix documentary ""The Game Changers"" made me want to look into this a little  bit more, it showed a lot of research, but I wanted to look it over myself, and figured I'd just ask you guys for more specific stuff.

I am in the process off going plant based and potentially vegan (I'm currently researching the ethical parts of killing or exploiting animals, thus this post). I have done some research but I haven't been able to find answers to some of my questions. I am probably misinformed about several things in what I am about to write. Feel free to point out any error!

1. If I am sick but not in a way which threatens my life (let's say I have a cold with a runny nose and a decently high fever), is it ethically ok for me to take drugs to ease my symptoms? Let's assume the medicine is made in a lab without animal products, but it is the result of animal testing. By buying the medicine I am giving the company money which they use on new RnD projects which means more animal testing. I am thus funding and incentivicing the killing of animals simply to ease my non-lethal symptoms, i.e for comfort. Am I missing something here or do vegans not use medications except in life threatening situations?
2. When it comes to animal testing for medicine in general, I am conflicted. The reason being that the medicine resulting from the animal testing saves human lives, and there is no alternative (is there?) to doing the animal tests. Given the choice between saving a human and saving a non-human animal I'd obviously save the human and I feel like the animal testing is a similar dilemma. Obviously it's not as clear cut as the choice I presented since you can't know which animal tests are going to yield a break-through and which will be essentially wasted.

7,What does dairy free cheese taste like?,I’m talking about the shreds and stuff. I have had a tree line cashew cheese (so good) cheese and I have had MiYoko’s made into a sauce but I haven’t tried the shreds as they don’t look good. I can see their ingredients are filtered water coconut oil potato starch natural flavors and salt. When I was in elementary school in the school cafeteria they gave us pizza which I don’t think had real cheese on it it kind of tasted plastic and it didn’t taste like the cheese you get on top of pizzeria pizza. That’s kind of what I will imagine it taste like.

36,Planning Christmas with the family - a conflicted thing,"Hi all, as the title suggests, I'm currently rather conflicted with regards to Christmas plans, so maybe you can give me some pointers and opinions - I feel kinda lost with this situation as I haven't had to deal with this before.

Quick outline: everyone except for my girlfriend and me is omni. When I ditched meat, I was told that it's okay (gee, thanks a bunch!) but I couldn't expect them to conform with my diet. Also, traditionally, Christmas dinner at home was meat fondue (aka a pot of soup on the table and everyone cooks bits of meat over the course of 2-3 hours).

Now, I'm living \~8 hours travel from my family, so I see them maybe once a year, which is why my mother was devastated when I told here we wouldn't be coming because ""joining in on the fondue is rather pointless"" (and disturbing, as I see it now). Also, as stated before, I was told beforehand that they wouldn't conform my wishes, which is why I didn't think of suggesting an alternative. However, after convincing my mom it's not just some excuse but an actual problem for me, she herself suggested we have an alternative. I was quite happy about this and told her my girlfriend and me could prepare a nice (vegan) dinner for the evening. 

All seemed well to me until I phoned my sister today, who responded to this change of plans with ""Ok so we can prepare one vegan dish and one with meat"". Now, I don't really see why we would need to go through the trouble of preparing two dishes if everyone could just as well eat the vegan dish. And, to be honest, us two vegans only decided to join the Christmas dinner with the prospect of having a meat-free evening. After some ""why can't everybody have what they want"", ""why is this a problem for you"", ""you vegans are so complicated"", ""so typical, all plans have to be made according to you vegans"" etc. the call ended (badly).

Am I overreacting to this ""make two dishes"" thing? How do you handle others insisting on meat? 

I'm not sure whether Christmas with the whole family will happen now - as it stands, either me or my sister will not join, in which case I would feel bad for my mom. But how can I make them see that this is really uncomfortable for me? Or should I just ignore the meat and go on their terms? Am i being egoistical for holding my values over my family even though I love them too?

Thanks for reading this far, and maybe you (yes, you!) can provide some insights for helping me to make a decision.",vegan,Fylmidei,1572567943,11,True,2019-10-31

12,000 people died during the swine flu epidemic, and 1/5th of Americans got the disease (60 million Americans). During April 2009, the Obama administration changed the name of swine flu to H1N1 in order to protect animal agriculture industry. 

It’s illegal to bad mouth the animal agriculture industry in 13 states, at least in 2013. One of these states includes Texas. 

“Milk. It does the body good.”, “Beef. It’s what’s for dinner..”, and “Pork. The other white meat.” are public ad campaigns that are government researched and funded with those $600 million budget.

61,"The word ""Vegan"" does not do justice to our cause.","I have always felt like the word ""vegan"" does not do justice to our cause.

Veganism primarily focuses on the alleviation of animal suffering but the word stem ""veg"" seems to get omnis thinking that what vegans really like is their veggies. It gets lumped into the same category as vegetarian.

Veganism is not a diet. It is an ethical position.

As someone who is on day 4 of the vegan journey and was an omni, I believe that this was what made it hard to take veganism seriously at the start. When I reconnected it to the animal suffering aspect, I instantly had a change of heart.

Perhaps veganism would have been more convincing to omnis at face value had it been termed something like ""compassionism"" or whatever smart thing someone can come up with. Ideally, the word should have been about a human value like peace/non-violence instead of the word ""veg""?

69,Fuck me for wanting to be nice for the animals,"My dad told me that me not eating meat is like me thinking that I'm better than God because he put the animals here for us to eat and I won't eat them. I then said that I don't eat animals because it isn't needed anymore. He said that it is needed. I said that we have plenty of plant based foods to eat that can provide us with a balanced diet. He said that pleasure in food is important. I said that I find pleasure in the food that I eat. He then made the ""but bacon"" argument and said that God wouldn't give us bacon just to take it away for us.

I dropped the subject as it wasn't going anywhere. He then asked me if I was going to do the dishes. I told him I'd do them if the food we ate didn't contain meat. He called that BS and said that I should move out. I told him that I am moving out in a month and he made a comment that he didn't mean about me moving out immediately.

I love my father. He's not a bad guy and I don't want to paint him as such. He's an extremely hard worker and has always done all that he can to provide for our family. It's just hard when we both feel very strongly about opposite views on something. This is so important to me.

""It would give you energy, it will help you loose weight, it will clear your skin, it will lift your mood, etc."" Most of those claims associated with veganism I considered to either be hype, outright bull, or something that wouldn't work for me.

I decided to start a whole food plant diet, simply because the evidence has been accumulating for so long, that it prolongs longevity and better health outcomes, that I couldn't continue to ignore it.   
Also because despite the fact I  strictly ate what is considered a healthy diet, and I was not healthy. I have Ulcerative Colitis and in the last year I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis. I'm 29 y.o. I have an amazing team of doctors, and the latest drug treatment I'm on is really good, and is helping me tremendously, but despite that my outlook on the future is grim. How long will the biologic medication stop working for me, just like all the previous meds had. Before I need surgery, or I become disabled, or I develop another chronic condition?

Only two days on the whole food plant diet I was feeling energetic. You don't know how much that means to me. People like me with chronic illness have a term to describe the struggle of low energy - [The Spoon Theory](https://butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/) &lt; I suggest everyone who doesn't know about it to read the link, and then go and hug the spoonies in their life.  
I would feel drained every day, have to skip on seeing family and friends to rest. Balance the pros and cons of going grocery shopping when I would be too tired when I come back to cook, and so much more. Your whole mindset changes, and the people around you get used to you saying no to them constantly, and eventually stop inviting you.

Only two days on the whole food plant based diet, and I felt better than I ever had before. I was so stupidly happy I ran up and down the stairs each chance I got. This influx of energy has not abated, I now exercises 15-20 minutes every day, simply because I have too much energy, something that would previously would've left me incapacitated for the day, or following day. The thought of doing it daily, would've been unthinkable. I'm waking up rested, and energized! It's amazing!

I hope this becomes my new normal, but I also don't want to ever forget, what a gift it is, to have the capacity to do the things I want in a day, and not be utterly drained all the time. 

Does anyone know - why? Why do vegans experience this jump in energy? I was not able to found a lot on the subject online, and its not talked about much, only mentioned.

I knew the environmental harm, I had spent years ignoring the welfare issues I couldn't reconcile with and I had had enough. I was fucking done. I'm almost at my year point of veganism. I stopped buying cows milk for home about two years ago, I had already been using only vegan toiletries and cosmetics for years. I was sitting in my backyard, thinking about the contents of my fridge and pantry. All that stood between me and actioning my values was one serving of cheese. Like giving up meat, I was fucking done. I felt like a hypocrite. I regret my years spent as a vegetarian, doing as much harm to the planet and animals as omnis. But I don't regret the initial decision to stop eating meat and I don't regret the decision to stop all animal products.

121,"It's so funny when the people who are obviously very unhealthy go on rants about how the thin, muscular vegans, who are full of energy, are starving their bodies of nutrients and are in fact the ""unhealthy"" ones.","This happens to me all the time. I had to delete my facebook because of people bullying me for making posts about my vegan journey. Yet we are the mean ones??? I can't even count how many people have tried to tell me that I am doing something unhealthy for my body. Yet the people who say that are obviously unhealthy and they don't even realize how unhealthy they are because they have never experienced what true health feels like. I have told them to try going vegan and they will see the difference but they prefer blissful ignorance. I have lost almost 40 pounds since going vegan. I am no longer overweight. I have abs coming in. I can do a push up for the first time in my life. I have so much energy that I didn't have before. My hair and nails are growing in much thicker. And the neurological effects are amazing. I had severe and debilitating ADD and now it is completely gone! My mind is clearer than it has ever been. I am happier than I have ever been in my life. I didn't see all the ways it was holding me back. The best part though, is that I am not taking place in the needless suffering of innocent life. I have lost almost every single person in my life because of this, and that is not an exaggeration. I don't understand why vegans are bullied so badly. I know it has something to do with people being brainwashed. But maybe losing them was just another one of the gifts that veganism has given me since they were obviously not people I want in my life. I don't want to be friends with someone who is going to interfere with my mission to do good. I will never stop fighting for what is right.",vegan,elorasolaris,1572612373,24,True,2019-11-01

&gt; ""A factor for low efficacy is that most influenza-vaccine viruses are propagated in eggs, and the vaccine virus changes during egg-based production in ways that facilitate replication in eggs but reduce vaccine effectiveness against circulating virus.""

&gt; ""A key change appears to be a mutation in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein that mediates receptor binding by neutralizing antibodies, according to a recent study from researchers at the Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.  The researchers identified an HA glucosylation site that was lost during egg adaptation but remained in circulating influenza A (H3N2) strains.""

142,How do you handle being vegan considering the amount of non-dietary products that come from animals?,"Hi,

I recently had a discussion with a friend about veganism. Neither of us is vegan but I was taking a defensive stance because I believe that regardless of if you are vegan for animal cruelty or some other reason, I recognize that cattle has a huge impact on the environment in terms of emissions. 

His point was that there's no 100% vegan, and/or that it's illogical to call yourself vegan. The reason for this is because so many of the products in our society come from animals, so in the end you're still contributing to the killing/mistreatment of animals. He showed me [this image](http://huntergatherer.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/500/no_such_thing_as_a_vegan.jpg). Now I haven't fact checked all of them and he did say that a few of those are not true anymore (e.g. instrument strings which are mostly made of steel now) but I did check pills and according to my research most capsules are indeed made from animal product.

152,Finally made the switch,"I did it guys, I finally transitioned to a vegan diet.

Awhile ago I posted here about my struggles transitioning. I had severe food intolerances to main staples like beans, legumes, gluten, and just about any grain. Each attempt was met with pain, blood, and a renewed frustration. You all had some suggestions, but in the end I felt like nothing would work and I was stuck eating this way forever.

Fast forward two years later. Went through one of the hardest times of my life. I was financially in the hole and I had to cut out meat to save money. I didn’t need it to survive, I knew that. I was vegetarian at this point and I felt alright. I started slowly introducing the foods that made me sick before, a little at a time. They still affected me, but not as much. Even though I had a negative reaction I kept at it. A little bit at a time I felt my gut biome adjusting and being able to digest everything. Oh my god, is it finally happening?

It’s been about 3 months on a vegan diet and I feel great. My workouts at the gym have improved, I don’t hit walls as often, and I recover quicker. I also have so much energy that I have a hard time falling asleep at night if I don’t work out or do something physically strenuous that day. I fart all the time it seems, but according to the internet that’s normal and it’s better than being in pain or bleeding. I’ve been educating myself through books and documentaries and learned so much more than just the health benefits.

It’s incredibly processed, refined, highly glycemic and needs to have synthetic vitamins added because they were removed in processing.

These vegan products are ethical, compassionate and cruelty free, but they are not healthy compared to their processed/frozen TV dinner counterparts. 

As far as the health component of Veganism is concerned, they fly directly in the opposite direction. These products are not good for your body, please stop marketing them as such, you have those green boxes that say “natural vegan Mac and Cheese” that containly highly processed flours and then they used things like processed safflower oil, the stuff they have to add solvents, extreme temperates to achieve, then add more chemicals to turn its gray oil product into a nice yellow oil that doesn’t smell rancid anymore.

I made the choice to adopt a vegan lifestyle about a year ago (with some setbacks) but now I’m truly ready to make the commitment with no excuses. However, the one thing I struggle with is honey. I’ve strictly used honey for medicinal purposes for the past year. Not as a sweetener because there are dozens of other options. But being an herbalist, I’ve used it in syrups and other remedies for my family’s healing. 

This post isn’t to justify the use of honey. I’m fully aware that it’s not vegan and am looking for find another alternative. So I’m curious, is there anything I can use as a substitute in my remedies? Like I said, it’s not simply for a sweetener but rather as medicine. Yeah I know I could use maple syrup or something like that, but I feel like the remedy wouldn’t be *quite* as effective as it could be.

199,Considering going vegan at 17.,"Hello, nice to meet all of you! My name is Zacharie, and I’m considering going vegan at 17. I’m a home schooled student for my senior year, and I’m going back to public school SOON, meanwhile starting a job to be able to afford this diet. 

WHY am I considering? Well, one of the main factors is of course because I favor animals, and as good as the food tastes, vegan foods can taste just the same without any harm done to an animal, or companies that harm animals will not have my support. Another reason is my weight, I’ve struggled with self image since I was 12-13 and want to turn this around before the possibility of an eating disorder. What way can I do that while making sure I stick to a diet if it means enjoying the same foods? by going vegan.

If I argued with myself from my freshman year, I’d have laughed and made a selfish edgy joke about veganism. I’d of made fun of vegans, and make stupid jokes about how meat is good. I’ve grown since then, and have considered many diets and still feel that vegan is the way to go. Only problem is, expenses, somewhat weak immune system, etc.

I want to make sure this goes as smoothly as possible, and make sure this can follow me into college this next year. I will take ANY advice, or links to cheap items to get for dinners, lunches, etc. I use target and walmart the most for groceries, so if there is cheap alternatives, please send them my way.

219,Things I learned after becoming Vegan,"Things I learned after becoming Vegan;

• If you feed animals and care for them temporarily, it's perfectly fine to send them to slaughterhouses, scare the living shit out of them, fire a bolt into their head and cut their throats. This is known as 'respecting the animals'. Thanking them for their 'sacrifice' (when they had no choice at all anyway) makes everything perfectly fine.

• Non-vegans buy their cow lactation fluid from ethical, non-enslaving, non-exploitative, non-harmful, beautiful green pasture farms that treat the cows like absolute royalty. All of the animals live their entire lives happily giving their lactation fluid to humans instead of feeding it to their babies. The cows and their babies grow old together and die naturally in their sleep. Cows exist solely for human benefit.

• As a society and species, we should exploit every animal on this earth. Exploiting and slaughtering animals is consistent with 'conservation', and this word makes us feel better about exploiting and slaughtering animals. Oh, except dogs and cats, who should be treated like royalty and are exempt.

• We should be angry at people who hurt animals, however we should ignore and defend the hurt, exploitation, slavery and pain that the animals in our fridge/freezer endured.

• Kicking, hurting and killing a single animal is absolutely not okay, however building large sheds/factories and hurting and killing millions of animals is logical and perfectly fine.

• When presented with facts that list compassinate and logical reasons to make changes to our lifestyles, it is easier to ignore and avoid the facts and continue on a path of destruction and selfishness. Changing our mentality and actions for the benefit of others is absolutely out of the question and illogical. Except for recycling at home. Recycling helps the environment and makes us feel good.

• If other people throughout our history have made the conscious decision to enslave, exploit and kill others, we should do it too. It makes sense. Exploiting and slaughtering others is what we should all do as human beings. Conscious decisions to have compassion for others is out of the question and illogical. Slavery and slaughter are what we should live for.

• Protein is what makes us human. I don't know what it really even is, but if other people say it enough times I should just repeat it too. We need to get protein from animals. That is our justification for enslaving and slaughtering animals daily.

• Although there are millions of people worldwide who survive perfectly fine eating plant foods, which is better for the environment, animals and far more sustainable, we should avoid this at all costs. It makes absolutely no sense to help anyone else, nor ourselves. We should continue to consume things that put us at greater risk.

221,Trying to substitute Eggs on Toast and Greek Yoghurt..,"Hi all, I'm on my journey to try and turn fully vegan

I recently substituted my lunches at work to be a combination of tofu with various vegetables and vinegar which i really enjoy.

My next aim is to substitute 

1) Eggs on toast which i have for dinner and i love as they are super easy to make (5 minutes), not messy in terms of cleaning up, high in protein and low in calories as well as very tasty. Preferably not with another tofu recipe

2) Greek Yoghurt 0% - very low in calories and a high protein tasty snack. I've tried alternative vegan yoghurts but have not liked any. Just looking for another low calories, tasy substitute that is vegan (doesn't have to be comparable to greek yoghurt in actual taste, just in calories, protein and in how tasty it is)

226,Why I Am Not a Vegan,"I am an organic vegetarian which means I only eat organic vegetarian food. I’ve been this way for 5-6 years and I feel great. Some people ask if I am a vegan and I am not one. 

I am not a vegan because vegans eat things that I would not give to animals or put in landfills. The food they eat is contaminated with pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, insecticides, etc. It is also grown in sludge (excrement) and has GMOs in it. These things tend to be bad for the human body, the environment and other lifeforms. 

I consider honey to be medicine, so I enjoy swallowing a little each day. Vegans are apparently divided on it, but they tend to avoid it because bees make it. However, honey has health benefits and I think it has benefits that we’ve been unable to measure. There is nothing like it too. Agave and maple do not have the same benefits. 

Organic food can’t have table salt in it because it contains synthetic additives like sodium aluminosilicate, silicon dioxide and magnesium carbonate. It also can’t have high fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated oils or artificial sweeteners in it. 

Organic food is healthier than vegan food. For instance, vegans eat processed food, but organic food is unprocessed or minimally processed. It can’t include synthetic preservatives, artificial colors or artificial flavors to be USDA certified organic food, but vegan food can have those additives. It also can’t have synthetic antibiotics or synthetic hormones in it. 

The human body is organic. Yours was organic. I think food is like medicine or poison and you have to make the right choices to become healthy and stay healthy. The healthiest diet you can eat and the best one for the environment and other lifeforms is an organic vegetarian diet. 

Some people eat with a lot of faith, but I don’t. I hope you eat the healthiest food that you can find and experience good health. The old adage “an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure” is true. Good luck.

371,Feeling Ashamed,"I went vegan about 2 week ago, and was vegetarian for about half the year before that... everyone gave me crap for being vegetarian for about 2 months but soon came around... When I decided to go vegan, because I’m lactose intolerant, and I knew this was my next step in my life , and especially for the animals, I got hate again... even worse now. I seem to make the people in my life even angrier by being vegan. I feel ashamed in a way... like my decision has made me an inconvenience for them. They tell me to go back being vegetarian, “the easier way”, so I guess I don’t have to inconvenience for them when they make me food. Even my own partner told me I’m not making a difference, they finally apologized but it still hurt. I overheard my mother in law tell my partner I’m making her life harder. This morning she said to my partner, I’m ungrateful because she made pancakes, that weren’t vegan friendly, but vegetarian friendly, and just because I didn’t eat any I’m being disrespectful. My partner has cut down on meat, which I’m happy about, but she hasn’t made the full transition into going vegetarian, which I’m fine with as long as there is progress. My other family has made me feel ashamed, especially over this last holiday whenever I went to my mother’s house for dinner, they made food but forgot I was vegan, or at least what it meant, and bought all this candy, pizza, and food that I couldn’t eat... I was questioned by my other family members what being vegan even was... and they all asked why I’m inconveniencing myself, why I’m picking an expensive lifestyle, what I can’t eat, what do I eat, and why I choose to go vegan? I had answers to all, but they seemed to not listen. I have depression and feeling as if I’m making someone angry at me makes me feel as I’m at fault. I just want to do what I think and know is right... 
I guess I’m just writing this to rant, maybe ask for advice, and how to not feel so wrong in my decision by going vegan when people say I’m inconveniencing myself and especially them.",vegan,Cipher360,1572712746,14,True,2019-11-02

483,Non-Graphic Vegan Informational Sources?,So I’ve been vegan for roughly 5 years now after watching a few documentaries. However I get depressed easily when it comes to seeing the actual conditions that animals are kept in. I just saw the article about the pigs being used as crash dummies in China and bawled until my boyfriend came in the room and pulled me out of it. I’m looking for recommendations of sites/ sources that provide information on factory farming and other vegan information/facts that don’t have the graphic images? Every time I’m asked why I’m vegan I struggle with providing accurate or more in depth information  which could help someone else consider veganism because I avoid graphic videos/articles.

Went back up to the counter to ask and they confirmed they made us normal whoppers but with vegan cheese and mayo. They were very apologetic and obviously didn't do it intentionally, plus gave us a refund immediately. 

Just kinda sad that we actually at meat after being vegan for so long. We do feel a bit to blame because we didn't check the receipt or double check the order at the counter.

So I started taking 500mcg daily to boost up my levels quickly, even though I've read the body really needs 3mcg daily. And anything extra come out in urine. The plan was to do that daily and after a week go down to 250mcg a day.

A few of days ago, I noticed the tint of my urine change from yellow, to a deeper yellow. Looking into it, I've found the colour of my urine associated with serious dehydration and liver damage.
I've also read that b12 can change the colour of your urine, but I've mostly seen that it changes to a bright yellow.

I'm just curious, if anyone else has experienced this. Also a little advice on taking b12 as a supplement. How should I be taking it and how frequently? Is 250mcg enough daily, or should I do that every other day?",vegan,eanacu,1572757518,10,True,2019-11-03

I waited far longer than I should have to make the switch but I'm recovering from an eating disorder and was wary of restricting my diet in any way, for a long time. 

I decided to give it a try and eat entirely vegan for the month of September, with the caveat that if I lapsed into disordered eating I would stop immediately. 

WTF YOU GUYS. IT WAS SO EASY. And I feel so much better. I can't believe I waited so long. Eating vegan doesn't feel restricting. It's freeing. 

I will say, it is kind of a bummer when people bring in treats to work. I'll just have to be the one bringing in treats from now on lol. By far the most annoying part was people's reaction to me eating vegan (despite me making every effort NOT to talk about it).

Also I am not worried at all about food and climate change and the scare tactics used by vegans. Agriculture, forestry, and other land use accounts for approx 4%\*. Why would I give up any food to save that 4% pollution, ridiculous. Most if not all of my food is local. Meat, dairy, eggs, bread, some fruit, all local.

I fried up about a third of a large white onion and some garlic in coconut oil. Threw in a can of chick peas, black eyed, and black beans after rinsing them well. Then a can of tomato sauce. I let that cook on low for a bit while I thought about the fact that more needed to go into it.

So I had some chopped baby bellas. Threw those in there. I have a lot of kale-- and my only regret with this is that I didn't rip it into smaller pieces. I'm new at kale. It's pretty tough. I chopped up 5 potatoes and threw those in there and turned up the heat for a while. I recently was doing reno on my kitchen so I don't even know where half my spices are. I used pepper... no salt, surprisingly. I overdo salt all the time. I love salt. Salt is the salt of the earth.

So anyway, I let it cook most of the evening. I kept tasting it. It was kinda bitter. So I added some sugar (like gramma used to do). Then I added more sugar. Then it was better. I grabbed myself a cup of the stuff to try. Omg the sauce was sauce, but everything else was awesome. I didn't think I'd like it so damn much. I think I can do this!

Ever since then I’ve been suffering from SIBO which is incredibly difficult to treat.

The issue with the diets people recommend for SIBO is that it excludes most carbs and lots of fiber. So rule out legumes, grains, fruits, and a bunch of vegetables.

I’d never not be vegan it’s really not an option especially 10 years in. Meat is repulsive. Idk how I’m supposed to restrict my diet even further trying to treat SIBO.

It’s rather debilitating and I’m a petite person with a huge bloated belly like legit I look mad pregnant. It has made me extremely depressed to the point of hopelessness/suicidal ideation.

“Can’t you quit veganism for one day”
“Haha I’m actually doing you a favour because I’m saving your food from being eaten by my food” 
“ you know you’re the one ruining the planet with your vegan diet”
“Why do you have to eat so weird”
“Vegan food is gross”
“Come have some of this [insert non vegan food item here] it’s vegan I swear”


*Waves food in my face* “mmm bet you miss this”
“When are you going to eat real food”
“They were made for food, it doesn’t matter what happened to them”
*they tell everyone I’m vegan and then later on mention the stereotype of vegans always telling everyone they’re vegan*
“It’s not even a big deal” 

*they like to try and get into arguments with me when I’m trying to avoid talking about veganism because I’m tired of having to defend myself*
“You’ll understand real life when you’re older”
“When you’re a real adult you’ll think differently” 

*they also constantly ask why vegans make vegan products to resemble animal products, I’ve answered this a ton (we don’t object to the flavour, we object to the cruelty and killing of living beings) but at this point they’re just asking because they think it makes vegans look dumb*

* they also constantly talk about how I must miss meat, or cheese or any other non vegan food product* 
*they also love to tell me how I’m not really vegan because of mistakes I’ve made (I know this isn’t true)*
“Veganism is a choice, being keto isn’t (they’re keto, I just find this one very laughable though haha)” 
“ you must not like us anymore because you never eat supper with us” 
“People are just too sensitive about these things now days”
*they are also think that vegan products shouldn’t use words like milk, burger, sausage, butter cheese, etc which is ridiculous* 


There’s about a million more things they say and do but I’m blanking. I guess I shouldn’t be surprised about my dad and stepmoms behaviour.

Most recent studies using more sensitive techniques for detecting B12 deficiency have found that 68% of vegetarians and 83% of vegans are B12 deficient, compared to just 5% of omnivores. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12816782 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10966896 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10552882

Vegetarians and omnivores have similar levels of serum iron, but levels of ferritin—the long-term storage form of iron—are lower in vegetarians than in omnivores. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24871479

Fruits and Vegetables https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12064344

This is significant, because ferritin depletion is the first stage of iron deficiency. Moreover, although vegetarians often have similar iron intakes to omnivores on paper, it is more common for vegetarians (and particularly vegans) to be iron deficient. For example, this study of 75 vegan women in Germany found that 40% of them were iron deficient, despite average iron intakes that were above the recommended daily allowance. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14988640 http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/3/633S.long

many plant foods that contain zinc also contain phytate, which inhibits zinc absorption. Vegetarian diets tend to reduce zinc absorption by about 35% compared with omniovorous diet. http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/3/633S.long

Thus, even when the diet meets or exceeds the RDA for zinc, deficiency may still occur. One study suggested that vegetarians may require up to 50% more zinc than omnivores for this reason. http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/3/633S.long

71,"Vegan ""challenge"" videos seriously depress me","
I just watched a 7 day vegan challenge video by a fairly large YouTuber.

It turned out exactly as you'd expect- vegan junk food and ice cream, concern about protein, subtle jabs at vegans (""guess this means I'm a better person than you now!""), comments about how vegan meat substitutes are gross, etc.

The YouTuber concluded that it was not as hard as they thought (even said it was fun)... But now they're back to paying for the murder of animals.

??? 
I know it's for entertainment and for clickbait but really?? They literally admitted that it was pretty easy to be vegan and that it was fun but now they're back to supporting cruelty? And pretty much ALL of these challenge videos are full of misinformation, jokes that poke fun at vegans, paranoia about protein, and so on. I don't think that any of this actually convinces viewers to try, especially since most of these people instantly go back to eating animals.

81,Mild Parent Success,"I'm almost 40 and visited my folks who live across the country. This was my second time visiting since going vegan. 

We had a big dinner with my vegan meatballs and everyone loved it. They were much more understanding and open minded than my visit last year. 

The next day my parents asked about vegetarianism. I explained the dairy industry is worse, with the extra layer of cruelty on top of all the cruelty of the meat industry. I asked them why a cow produces milk, what happens to their babies, how do they stay pregnant, and much like myself, my parents said they had never even thought about that at all, and actually seemed affected by what I said!

That night I managed to talk them into watching an Earthling Ed video, the one where he gives a 30 minute talk to a classroom. The next morning my Dad said he's getting more and more convinced, and would actually cut out meat. My parents were forwarding the video to their friends.

A few days later I watched What the Health with my mom. She was so into it, following along, being shocked as the realisations hit her, just as it did with me. After the movie, she was writing emails to her friends about it. Over the next few days I would hear my mom talking to other family members about the movie, reciting certain moments. It actually gave me this warm feeling inside.

I'm back in Seattle, and yesterday my Dad sent me an email saying he has been good about cutting out meat, but dairy is just difficult because it's in so many foods. It's ok to me that he's made that one step. My parents are pretty old. He also told me he's proud of me, and I don't know about any of you but that's something I don't hear. I'm proud of him too.

94,"Red and processed meat are OK to eat, controversial new guidelines claim - DEBUNKED.","Honestly tired of the reporting. Did no one fact-check this study?

A recent study was published by Annals of Internal Medicine. I usually don't even look at pro-meat studies because they are easily debunked (usually funded by the meat industry, glaring methodology problems, not factoring in additional variables, etc), but this one is a meta study of four studies, which are themselves meta-studies of 100+ studies each. It's being reported left and right so I want to address it.

The goal of the post is to dissect this study and (hopefully) debunk its claims. Hopefully to get ahead of the media's reporting on it. 

[Link to the paper here](https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2752328/unprocessed-red-meat-processed-meat-consumption-dietary-guideline-recommendations-from)

##The recommendation.

What most media outlets focus on is the recommendation itself.

Their recommendation is as follows:

&gt;For adults 18 years of age or older, we suggest continuing current processed meat consumption (weak recommendation, low-certainty evidence). Again, 11 of 14 panel members voted for a continuation of current processed meat consumption, and 3 voted for a weak recommendation to reduce processed meat consumption.

Why make this recommendation based on low-certainty evidence? 

##Evidence

&gt;we found low- to very low-certainty evidence that diets lower in unprocessed red meat may have little or no effect on the risk for major cardiometabolic outcomes and cancer mortality and incidence.

The evidence for this is from a meta-study with 0 citations that was published *the same day* and was authored by the same people. They hand-picked studies funded by Meat and Livestock, Australian Pork, ad National Cattlemen's Beef Association. So although *this* study wasn't founded by any party, it uses a study that uses studies that *did*. Pretty scummy IMO. 

Unless I missed something when reviewing that article, it seems they completely cherry picked the data as well. Of the 13190 records they screened, where they identified they have no duplicates - they picked a mere 1507 for no explainable reason. Then they took those 1507 and cut them down to 24 because they didn't fit the design of the study. So out of 13190, they took 24 studies that confirmed their bias. That's 0.1%. **Talk about cherry picking data.**

##Conclusion

This post got really long, and I've only addressed one line in their article. But it's clearly BS. Almost **ALL** of their sources are meta-studies they themselves had written with 0 citations that were published on the same day. Having looked at a few of them, it's very clear they grossly misrepresented the data to fit an agenda, and have hidden behind the term meta-analysis.",vegan,KinOfMany,1570010936,0,True,2019-10-02

And spare the honey which the bees get industriously from the flowers of fragrant plants; For they did not store it that it might belong to others, Nor did they gather it for bounty and gifts.

I wasn’t surprised of course, but a bit annoyed. I corrected them and said no dairy. For some reason I was given fish the next day. At that point I had to eat because I hadn’t eaten anything with proteins in it. After that my meals were vegan but I couldn’t keep eating them because they weren’t nutritious at all. I was given celery, carrots and cucumbers with a vegetable juice box. That was it. Same thing the day after. It took them 2 days to give me a few cubes of raw tofu and a veggie patty (the kind made of beans) but it was very inconsistent. I have no idea how long I’ll still be in the hospital because my medication has to be adjusted so I had to make exceptions to not starve, meaning eating meat and dairy a few times and it grossed me out every time. Right now I have the vegetarian option ticked but I still have to make exceptions because even that one is lacking. 

A few weeks ago I signed a petition for more vegan options in canteens and public establishments and I’m really glad I did after witnessing myself how terrible it is. It’s not just a “oh, all hospital food is gross” because the omni menu is actually very decent and surprising.

Have you used HappyCow? Do you really like it?

I've personally find it extremely unsettling that it is the only vegan-friendly restaurant finder on the market, as the design of it very poor, its clunky, cheaply-made, and ultimately I've not found it to be too much more helpful than Yelp or Google reviews.

I was out for drinks with a friend and found some delicious Seitan Wings on their menu, nowhere to be found on HappyCow.

147,Not doing enough as a vegan,"So I've been vegan for over 2 years now and about a year after I first went vegan, I started watching some vegan youtubers and joined a few local vegan communities to keep learning more about the industries as well as the health benefits of being on a vegan diet. At first when I began watching these channels and going to these events, things seemed pretty civil (e.g. they would just explain facts about the industries or scientific studies and highlight why it is important to be vegan). It definitely seemed great in comparison to some of the extreme, and arguably aggressive, vegan youtube channels that I had seen previously. However, I've noticed that some of these channels that I've been watching have been becoming more similar to the latter. I no longer feel welcome in the community as it keeps being reiterated to me by these channels (as well as some vegans I have met in real life) that I am not doing enough for the movement because I'm not involved in activism. A handful of vegans I have met in my personal life have told me that I may as well not be vegan if I'm not going to help out in activism. 

When I first went vegan I did try to help out in activism, whenever people in my personal life would try to debunk or criticise veganism I would argue back with facts, and I joined the committee of my university's vegan society to create artwork for activism. But then my physical health started to get in the way, and as a result I was struggling with my university work, I became too fatigued to spend time doing hobbies, and I stopped trying to defend myself when people criticised veganism or criticised me for being vegan. I couldn't bear to go to animal rights marches because my social anxiety became exacerbated by my health problems. I no longer had energy to create the artwork for my university's vegan society, and if I'm honest, I never enjoyed doing it in the first place. I love to create conceptual and meaningful artwork but the ideas aren't something which can be forced. A lot of the pieces I paint are much more related to personal struggles because art has always served a therapeutic purpose for me, and having to keep trying so hard to come up with inventive ways to get a message across for vegan artwork killed the fun of painting for me. I'm not sure what I should do anymore.

I have been so angry recently and I don't want to be because it sucks but how can you not be?
Trying to be nice when people continue to ignore and destroy the planet that we have to share is just impossible at this point.
Like yes hello some Vegans are crazy but can you blame us when we are constantly surrounded by corpses and people acting like it's all perfectly great. Maybe we are the sane ones for being outraged at the treatment of other beings whom share this planet with us, and having to share in the consequences of your actions.

I'd say ""I'm sad that I know meat, cheese and dairy is delicious but its taste doesn't justify cruelty animals are under and their deaths"". I'm vegan only for 10 months but still all those beings that I devoured, all those lifes I took. I'd like to go back in time and tell younger me what I did when I chose to eat everything that brings so much pain to the world. There is nothing else I can do right now. But for real... We should stop deaths of humans and animals. We should find a way that people won't eat other living beings such as animals and will still live with full tummy. It's like holocaust for  animals. It's just too sad to think about it. It's even worse that people don't act on this(or see this). I know that we live in unfair and cruel world and our expectations may be too good to be true. But we need to do everything we can to be better souls/people. 
What I mean by that is: ""We shouldn't let death win. Not so easily."" When I speak about ""death"" I'm speaking about everything that is slipping from our fingers/hands that ""death"" is waiting to take( our lives, lives of the other people and animals lives).

I hate to complain but I got tired of eating the same few things for a couple years, and my family questioning me at every family party. 

I can't tell y'all how many times I've heard ""so you're still not eating meat???"" from relatives

and of course jokes or ridicules, with my dad being a meat manager. my family was super relieved when I started eating meat with them again and said they knew id get over it, and continued to joke about it for a couple months, then it went back to ""normal.""

my plan was to go back to being vegetarian whenever I live on my own then transition into veganism. I'm a freshman in college now (community college, im still at home), and I want to become vegan. vegetarianism is a seemingly nice sidetrack, but all the way is the best way. am I right?

266,need some friendly advice from some fellow vegans regarding cats.,"

I, my wife, and son are all vegan. we’ve been vegan for a few years now. we’ve all taken steps to veganize pretty much every aspect of our lives. we do still own a few leather goods from before we were vegan, but since becoming vegan we have stopped buying all products containing animal elements. we also try to make sure whatever we are buying is ethically sourced whenever possible. 

earlier this week my wife was buying a new pet carrier for our two dogs (who are also both vegan, we’ve done a lot of research so we are making sure they are getting all the necessary nutrition they need) when she met 2 cats who were from a local shelter. our pet supply store sometimes hosts animals like this to try and give them a better chance at being adopted. these cats are brother and sister, five months old, rescued from texas. I guess they have been at our pet supply store for a while and are going to have to got back to the shelter this sunday where their fate will be uncertain, if you gather my meaning. 

my wife and son want to rescue them. 

now I have done a lot of research on the subject and know that cats, unlike dogs, cannot go vegan. they are obligate carnivores. there is no healthy way, as of yet, for them to live a plant based life. 

on one hand, it would be great to save these cats from an uncertain fate and i’d be happy to take them in but...

we have put a lot of thought and effort into living as cruelty free as humanly possible in modern society. I feel good knowing I don’t contribute to the torture and death of untold billions on a yearly basis. I feel more assured in my activism both in cyberspace and meatspace knowing I can talk the talk *and* walk the walk. 

I view the idea of taking these cats in as a major blemish on all that. I think i’d feel guilty literally every time I fed them. my wife argues that they are alive now and if they did manage to get adopted without our help, they’d still be getting fed animal meat. if they don’t get adopted we would be contributing to their deaths through inaction. 

I just don’t know if rescuing them justifies the moral cost of keeping them alive in my mind. I would really love to take them home, but I am incredibly conflicted about the ethics of the situation. 

if you are someone who has dealt with a similar situation or just has helpful input, i’m all ears. please keep comments respectful, constructive, and chill. i’m asking this here explicitly to avoid the static of general reddit so please keep flaming to a minimum.

268,i think i understand how some vegans and vegetarians feel about meat after today,"so, there's this thing called Chapulines that i found out about a few days ago that i thought seemed interesting. in some rural areas of mexico, they either toast or fry grasshoppers. it probably started as a desperation food i'm guessing, but now it's just normal. so then i thought ""hey, there are grasshoppers where i live, and i like to cook. why don't i try to make this?""  


so this morning i wake up nice and early, go out with a bug net and catch some grasshoppers for a few hours. i had to kill and clean them (remove their guts, wings, and legs, and heads), and i'm not disturbed by the idea of killing and cleaning an animal, i've done it before because i used to hunt when i was younger as a family activity, and i'm no stranger to killing spiders i find in my house because i hate them, but doing this to bugs, knowing that it was because i was intending to eat them, was such a disgusting experience. the more i did it, and the more time passed, the more i realized there was no way i can force myself to cook these things, let alone put them in my mouth. if i did, i would probably puke.   


i'm still going to continue to eat meat, this hasn't turned me into a vegan, but i used to have a friend who was a vegetarian, and she explained that she decided she was done with meat when she was a kid and she watched her parents preparing a turkey. the whole thing of dismantling it and handling all these gross slimy animal parts disgusted her so much that she couldn't eat meat afterward. i could never put myself in her shoes, but i think i have some semblance of that feeling now. it will probably sound like a bit of a stretch, but i honestly think the feeling i felt earlier today was either very similar, or the same as how she feels about meat.",vegan,smemmy,1570066989,2,True,2019-10-02

* Expand the Milk Marketing Law, a dairy specific regulation for the Milk Marketing Board, to oversee the marketing of plant based milk.

This is why **Animal Rebellion** was created.

We are a mass volunteer movement, employing Non-Violent Direct Action methods (e.g. Civil Disobedience), demanding that the governments abolish the destructive animal farming and fishing industries, and lead a **transition to 100% plant-based food production systems.** We recognise that a vegan, plant-based food system is the only food system that can minimise the risk of climate breakdown, halt mass extinction and avert social collapse. 

The Rebellion begins on 07 October in London, UK (and other places across the world), where in solidarity with Extinction Rebellion, Animal Rebellion will mobilise thousands of animal advocates for a two-week rebellion. Together, we will deliver the result and bring about this massive change on a global scale!

If you want to help change the world by ending animal agriculture and fishing, this is what you can do:

313,how do you deal with the awkward ‘i can’t eat this meal you’ve made me’ conversation?,"im recently vegan (6 months on/off, 2 months strict vegan) and loving it.

my family are all farmers and big on their meat and dairy. tonight my sisters and i went to our grandparents for dinner tonight. i had told her before that i wasn’t eating dairy or meat or eggs when she questioned why i was only eating veggies a few weeks ago. when we got to my grandparents house my lovely grandma was very very proud of the dairy free soup she had made! she’s usually very heavy on the cream and milk in all dinners. 

when i got to serving it i noticed it had big chunks of lamb in it. i just avoided serving myself the lamb even though i felt sick thinking about it bc i didn’t want to hurt my grandmas feelings. when we went to eat my older sister was like ‘oh, {me} your eating meat!’ and my grandma got all upset that she had forgotten and tried to take my bowl away and make me something else. i laughed it off saying it’s fine, it’s not a big deal but felt like crying. i hate feeling like i’m an inconvenience and with my new diet it makes it so much harder going anywhere. 

on thé upside though my grandma got me three different types of vegan ice creams because she didn’t know which one i would like :))) (even though my grandpa huffed and puffed the whole time that i was killing the dairy industry)

so how do you deal with those awkward times you can’t eat something someone’s made for you or admitting your ‘different’ and your diet is probably super annoying to accommodate to ?",vegan,kskskpppp,1570092851,21,True,2019-10-03

It might push them away from veganism forever!","If you see anyone being judgemental towards a vegetarian, don't stay quiet. Since I've become a vegan, a total of 0 people from my family and friends even flinched when I described to them what they do to the animals in slaughterhouses. I thought that people simply didn't know but the harsh reality is that they simply don't care. These are people that I love and I would die for, so it was extremely difficult to come to terms with this new reality I had to live in. 

A vegetarian took a step that most people won't even consider taking in the first place, let alone try. Even if they can't give up cheese or milk for whatever reason, they're still trying. If their reasons for turning vegetarian are strong and pure, then eventually they'll go vegan. Otherwise they'll either stay vegetarians which means they still refuse to ""fully"" contribute to the atrocities that are occurring, or they'll regress back to being an omni, and you can just move on. Judging them and making memes about them only adds to the idea that all vegans are toxic and horrible people. Don't let your frustration with people turn into toxicity.

339,"How to deal with vegan ""gotcha""s?? Crucified for 'not being 100% vegan'.","I'm going to preface this by saying that I've only been vegan for about 3 years and while I would prefer that everyone else was too, I've never been confrontational about 'converting' other people to become vegans, but instead live as an example of someone that lives a perfectly normal lifestyle while omitting animal products from it as much as possible.

So today at work we had a celebration. And just like every other celebration there was food (all non-vegan). Per usual, I deny the food and the topic of my veganism comes into conversation. So we end up talking a bit and eventually my coworkers reach the conclusion that I'm a fake vegan because I don't eat a 100% raw vegan diet and am ""only a vegan until it's not convenient"" mind you, none of them are vegan.

These are a few of their reasons with some of my counter-points (but I really need help on this front)

Them: ""I saw you eating fig bars and swedish fish, those aren't vegan.""

Me: ""Well actually the brand of fig bars I was eating are **certified vegan** and swedish fish are vegan too unless you get the ones with beeswax.""

Them: ""But what about the sugar?! The sugar in those products were processed with bone char!""
(surprised they even bothered to know this)

Me: ""Still no, in order for a product to be certified vegan, it has to meet a list of requirements that insure the product is such. I don't know about the swedish fish though.""

Them: ""So the sugar could have bone char in it, you just don't care to know, so you aren't a vegan. Also did you know wheat isn't vegan because mice get caught in the process?? That means you can't have bread either.""

Me: ""Well typically, veganism is about practicing it as much as possible, and companies aren't required to state the sugar refining process for the sugar in their products, so there is no real way to know without them stating it. And for that mice thing, it's not like they're intentionally adding mice to the product, it just happens that they get mixed up in there, like there are bugs in like everything we eat.""

Them: ""So then why are you eating them if there is a possibility of them having animal products?? You say practice as much as possible, but you could stop eating them and only eat vegetables. There is no reason that you can't do that.""

Me: ""Well yeah, I could go that route and definitely would like to be able to do that, but  right now I'm not ready to make that leap.""

Them: ""So you're only a vegan until it's not convenient? Then you're not a vegan.""

Me:""No, it's just impractical to believe, in the modern world, that I can be 100% vegan, unless I live in some shack in the woods eating homegrown potatoes. There isn't a such thing as 100% vegan, and some of the issues are very negligible. Take for instance, cars. You'd be hard pressed to find an all vegan car, unless you shelled out a buttload of money to get it custom made. Sometimes it's not feasible for everyone.""

Them: ""Well if you're really vegan, that's the price you have to pay. You could save up for that. You don't get to pick and choose, you either are or aren't vegan. It's not hard. You're just a hypocrite.""
(Implying that I can't drive unless the car is vegan)

At this point, I kind of ended the conversation, but as someone who has never really dealt with people being so persistent about me being a 'fake vegan' I couldn't help but think about some of the things they said.

Other points they've made during other times:

-You don't know if our handsoap was tested on animals so you can't use it 

-Flu shots have eggs in them so you can't get one

-You still wear leather (all purchased before I was vegan) so you're not vegan

-You didn't intervene when I killed that fly the other day, so you don't care about animals


**TLDR:  Non-vegan Co-workers give me grief over miniscule points to counter modern veganism for folks who aren't ""all in"" according to their definition of what it is to be vegan.**

Before my heart attack I was a 100% clean eater, berries, vegetables, dairy  and lean meat once or twice per week.  I am not a fan of supplements and prefer to get all my nutrients from whole real foods.  With being both diabetic and having heart issues they both seem to have conflicting nutritional needs...no carbs or sugar for diabetes...low fat, sodium for heart...which seems to leave almost nothing to eat.  After doing research and such I'm not as concerned about the carbs effect on my BG (although a little concerned about sugar in fruit, guess I""ll have to experiment)  but I'm concerned with nutrients and best ways to obtain macro and micro nutrients from completely clean sources.  Seems like the biggest issue is Vitamin B12 and protein (got most of my protein from dairy).  I read about almond milk fortified with b12 but every almond milk i look at is filled with crap on the ingredients list.

I want to become vegan because the planet is dying. Everyday I tell myself I should do it but I can't help myself but eating meat. I love meat.

I decided to try liquid smoke but the taste is a bit weird in large amounts. I also tried to fry soja beas but when I finish eating I am still hungry and I need to eat meat to feel filled. I found some really good looking dishes but I am a novice cook and I might need easier recipes.

24,Passive Marketing and Spending of Your Vegan Money at Corporate Fast Food Restaurants is Contributing to the Increase in Meat Consumption and Leading to the Death of More Animals,"I know this is a very hot topic at the moment and I'm guaranteed to piss a lot of people off, so before you down vote, please hear me out.

**TLDR: by passively marketing for and spending money at unethical fast food companies, you are giving them more customers, driving the sale of meat products and increasing profits to be used in furthering the suffering of animals.**

Business Insider recently published an article discussing an increase in sales of BEEF Whoppers, due to the release and popularity of the Impossible Whopper. Yes you heard that right. [You can read the article here](https://www.businessinsider.com/impossible-whopper-boosts-burger-king-sales-2019-9). This news comes to light the same year as the USDA's report showing meat consumption on the rise in the United States.

I see no reason not to assume that meat sales have also increased for other unethical fast food corporations like KFC, due to their vegan targeted marketing campaign.

I know there is an urge among a lot of vegans to one day be able to fully participate in mainstream consumerist culture. But we can not trust or rely on corporations to make ethical decisions regarding animal welfare, especially when the suffering of animals is a commodity and completely tied to capitalism.

There was a time I believed that our community was much smarter then this. It's inherent in veganism to question the actions of these companies and how they market to us. We do this every single day. Every time you see an advertisement from the dairy industry or when you go shopping and look at the ingredients on the back of a box. If you are vegan long enough it becomes second nature.

So why is it that this all goes out the window when corporations like Burger King, KFC and Impossible Foods offer up new marketing campaigns directly aimed at our dollars? It's just post after post of community members doing the marketing work for these terrible companies, recruiting friends and strangers to give their dollars, dollars that will be used to commodify more animals.

Sure, if given the choice I'd rather have someone that was going to buy a burger, choose a vegan version. But if you are vegan, and you give Burger King or KFC your money, you are not doing any animal a favor. It isn't activism and you are contributing to the problem. You have a responsibility as a vegan to do what is in your means to limit the suffering of animals.

I'm sure someone will leave a comment regarding my privilege or purist ideals or something of that nature (go to way of trying to shut down dialog). For context, I've been vegan for 18 years. Long enough to remember there being no vegan restaurants. I grew up in poverty, have been homeless, and squatted for many years. There were times I had to dumpster for food or starve. During much of those difficult times I still held strong to my ideals. There is a responsibility that we have when taking on the ideals of veganism. It's to do what ever is in our means to end the suffering of animals. Not just when it's convenient...insert fast food joke here.",vegan,djangokill,1567386292,3,True,2019-09-01

Sometimes I feel like even the people on this sub don't get the extent to which is problem lies. About 70,000,000,000 animals are killed each year by humans. That level of suffering, even if you're generous and assume every one of them lived happily until the point of slaughter, is just incomprehensible.

One of the most consistent epidemiological associations between diet and human disease risk is the impact of red meat consumption (beef, pork, and lamb, particularly in processed forms). While risk estimates vary, associations are reported with all-cause mortality, colorectal and other carcinomas, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, and possibly other inflammatory processes https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098299716300401?via%3Dihub




The population-based prospective Cohort of Swedish Men (COSM) included 37 035 men, aged 45-79 y, with no history of HF, ischemic heart disease, or cancer at baseline. Meat consumption was assessed with a self-administered questionnaire in 1997. During a mean follow-up of 11.8 y, 2891 incidences and 266 deaths from HF were ascertained. Consumption of processed meat was statistically significant positively associated with risk of HF in both age- and multivariable-adjusted models. Men who consumed ≥75 g/d processed meat compared to those who consumed &lt;25 g/d had a 1.28 (95% CI: 1.10-1.48, P-trend=0.01) higher risk of HF incidence and 2.43 (95% CI: 1.52-3.88, P-trend&lt;0.001) higher risk of HF mortality. The consumption of unprocessed meat was not associated with increased risk of incidence of HF or mortality from HF. http://circheartfailure.ahajournals.org/content/early/2014/06/11/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.113.000921.short

There was no convincing lack of association between saturated fat and CHD mortality (1.15, 0.97 to 1.36; P=0.10). For trans fats, one to six prospective cohort studies for each association were pooled (two to seven comparisons with 12 942-230 135 participants). Total trans fat intake was associated with all cause mortality (1.34, 1.16 to 1.56), CHD mortality (1.28, 1.09 to 1.50), and total CHD (1.21, 1.10 to 1.33) but not ischemic stroke (1.07, 0.88 to 1.28) or type 2 diabetes (1.10, 0.95 to 1.27). Industrial, but not ruminant, trans fats were associated with CHD mortality (1.18 (1.04 to 1.33) v 1.01 (0.71 to 1.43)) and CHD (1.42 (1.05 to 1.92) v 0.93 (0.73 to 1.18)). Ruminant trans-palmitoleic acid was inversely associated with type 2 diabetes (0.58, 0.46 to 0.74). The certainty of associations between saturated fat and all outcomes was “very low.” The certainty of associations of trans fat with CHD outcomes was “moderate” and “very low” to “low” for other associations. https://www.bmj.com/content/351/bmj.h3978/




Myocardial infarction in red meat consumption by Oxford study Red meat consumption was significantly positively associated with ferritin concentrations and MI risk [HR per 50 g daily intake: 1.18 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.33)], but no significant associations with stroke risk and CVD mortality were observed. While direct associations between ferritin concentrations and MI risk as well as CVD mortality were significant in age- and sex-adjusted Cox regression models, these associations were substantially attenuated and no longer significant after multivariable adjustment for classical CVD risk factors. Strikingly, ferritin concentrations were positively associated with a majority of classical CVD risk factors (age, male sex, alcohol intake, obesity, inflammation, and lower education). https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-abstract/107/1/113/4763681?redirectedFrom=fulltext

""Are you fucking kidding me?"" I told her, sternly.  

She stood back, wincing as she realized her foolish mistake.  

""Don't you know that chickens and cows are MURDERED AND RAPED everyday for pepperoni and cheese?"" I said, informing her about her bigoted eco-fascist diet.  

When her mom came over to pick her up, she started crying and said I was 'mean'.  

""Do you know what's mean? Murdering and raping goats and chicken just for pepperoni and leather. Don't you know that by eating pepperoni pizza, you're contributing to genocide and climate change.""  

My sister can be pretty stupid sometimes, so it's no wonder that she refused to let me educate her daughter.

60,Can't be vegan,"I've been plant based for a few months now, and ""mostly"" vegan (on/off, mostly on) for nearly 2 years and I am going to give up. Originally I wanted to just go vegetarian, but I became lactose intolerant at the start as well and I don't really like eggs that much so I was essentially vegan with a little cheese and meat in between. I'm not an animal activist by any means but I thought cows and pigs and chickens are cute and I wanted to be healthy which were my two main reasons. However it is a challenge to balance it right and I keep feeling weak. I supplement vitamin d and take soy milk fortified with b12. Upon reviewing my bloodwork I noticed some things were off, my blood sugar is within normal range but higher than it was before (in the 90s now, before 81). And my blood pressure increased from 100/67 to 112/74. Also my creatine levels were low, iron was ok. I did notice how much lean muscle I lost and it feels like my body fat % went up. I tried to eat as healthy as possible, get fortified soy milk, grains (I admit mostly white rice, but whole wheat bread and quinoa), tofu, veggies, and a some beans/peanuts - can't eat too much because it gives me gas and bloating. Ultimately I feel like I am weak a lot and now I'm noticing my hair is a bit more brittle and dry too. I'm guessing it's because I don't eat enough calories, protein, or fat. I relied on carbs and not enough protein. I'm a college student surviving on dining hall food or budget groceries at walmart and don't have time to plan around all these things. It's very hard to maintain in the long term. I realize if I was left in the wild to fend for myself I would end up hunting an animal at some point. Yes I ""like"" animals and would prefer to not eat them, if I wasn't lactose intolerant I would settle as a vegetarian and just eat cheese and drink milk. but I also see them as food in the end and can't handle planning a balanced vegan diet right now",vegan,forestsandunicorns,1567405575,22,True,2019-09-02
62,San Antonio veg fest,"I went today and just wanna comment how impressed I was! So many amazing food options and people were selling out everywhere. I'm someone who has struggled with veganism in the past. Gone ""plant based"" and then reverted back to seafood etc. There was a while where I was buying cruelty free products and only eating eggs etc.. But I've been a full vegan in any way I can for the last two months. Anyway, a real reason I always struggled was because I felt things weren't as accessible and id lose hope and give up. This was totally different!!! Foods of all amazing kinds. I loved it.

Yes sometimes it's hard as fuck eating out and feels discouraging but this stuff helps and helped me find more things to try and do when we go to San Antonio (we are 30 min away).

My husband is mixed race and am omni and has told me he thinks vegan is definitely a white thing. I tell him it's not but living in the south etc lots of black people would never be vegan based on his experiences with his family. Well shout out to all the beautiful black vegan people there because I saw all of you and thank you for showing to him that veganism is for everyone.

63,Single and young vegans. PLEASE READ!,"
My fellow vegans, especially those of you who are single and young, do not get into a serious relationship based on a vegan bond, however strong it is. Even if you want to, make sure they have been vegan/vegetarian for a VERY long time (almost their entire life). I learnt this the hard way and I do not want this to happen to anyone. Especially to those who are strict about only dating vegans/vegetarians. 

My wife was the staunchest vegan I have ever known. I met her in the New Zealand vegan dating group three years ago. Few years after adopting the vegan lifestyle in 2013, she started experiencing gut illnesses. A month ago, she was convinced that plants &amp; carbs were the culprits for her poor gut health after doing tons of research and wanted to stray from veganism. I objected first due to the strong bond we had due to veganism.  After a few discussions, my love and care took over and I told her I'd be okay with whatever she eats as long as she is healthy and happy. She tried dairy and eggs first. There was improvement but not as much as she hoped for.

She saw a doctor and he said her gut health was pretty poor and that she was pretty close to Chron's Disease. The doctor told her to eat mostly animal based foods such as meat, eggs and dairy. Apparently, fiber makes her guts flare up. Even though veganism was the sole foundation of our relationship and that I haven't eaten meat or eggs my whole life, I was prepared to have a marriage where one member is a hardcore omni. But things changed for the worse and everything went downhill. 

She started doing research about ex-vegans and she started turning to the dark side by the day. When I met her, she used to debate with everyone that humans were herbivores/frugivores. Now she is convinced humans are OBLIGATE CARNIVORES. The body apparently needs animal cholesterol to function and plants are 100% detrimental to human health. (It gets worse)

Everyday, I was waking up to her shoving ""credible research"" about pro-meat/anti-vegan studies in my face. Apparently some study showed that vegans have more brain shrinkage over time as opposed to omnis. She kept pestering me to eat meat otherwise I'd go retarded. She shared another research that stated it's technically impossible to be vegan because when you're on a plant-based diet, your body eats on your muscles due to lack of animal protein (It gets worse).

Through a video, she arrived at a conclusion that even herbivores aren't herbivores and they start eating animals due to lack of animal protein. She said it's graphic so I am scared to watch it. If someone has the stomach to watch animal violence, please go ahead and opine on it in the comments:  

https://youtu.be/TdTXaFtDqZE

Oh yes, it still gets worse. As per her research, plants apparently release toxins when they are harvested. These toxins are detrimental for the human body's immune system and can lead to depression, heart disease etc. Whenever I joyfully shared a pic of what I was eating at work, she always scorned at it because it was plant-based and full of toxins. It came to a point where I put my foot down and told her to not impose her omni lifestyle on me in a ""You do you"" way. I also reminded her that when she was vegan, she told me she would leave me instantly if I quit veganism and that it's extremely unfair to change me into the very thing she hated once. Her reply to all of this was ""Fine. I refuse to cook toxins for you from now on"". I keep telling her I have been vegetarian all my life and the farthest I can go is consume dairy from a legit happy cow farm.

We used to feed ducks. Now she eats ducks. Her omni parents were gonna slaughter and eat a rescued chicken in 2018. She cried that it was gonna die so I went out of my way to find a rescue shelter via this group and made her happy. Now she eats chickens and tells me to eat them cuz I am not a cow but a lion, an obligate carnivore. ""Don't be a deluded vegan hippie"" she said. She did petty things like change my name to ""Angry Vegan"" on her phone. The same person who used to share Gary's best speech with her omni friends and family started using the ""circle of life"" argument and claimed she'd even go as far as hunting animals instead of supporting factory farming.  I didn't know who my wife was anymore. We decided to get separated few days ago. I gave it all I had to save this marriage. I really tried but everything was devolving.

72,How do you cope with vegan related depression?,"When I say vegan related depression, I mean getting depressed about animal cruelty, being bullied for being vegan etc.. Depression runs in my family, I've been clinically depressed since I was a teenager but it seems that no matter how much I try to keep my depression in check, my mood is always brought down whenever I'm reminded of animal cruely or when I see people hating on vegans online. No amount of anti-depressents or healthy living can ever stop me getting depressed about animal cruelty. 

I've been vegan for almost 7 years, and I'm tired of people picking arguments with me whenever they find out I'm vegan. I just don't get what their problem is? I never bring up my veganism unless it's relevant, I try to avoid the topic because talking about veganism just makes me sad. I remember in school the new girl used to offer me snacks in history class and they'd never be vegan and I had to keep saying ""No thanks, I'm good""  for weeks because I didn't want to sound obnoxious by telling her I wouldn't eat her food because I'm vegan. But people in school would still claim that I was preachy and never stopped talking about veganism, when I'd only talk about it if they asked about it. 

I know it sounds dramatic, but I sometimes get so disturbed at the thought of the amount of animals being abused for food, cosmetics, clothing etc, that I think about killing myself because I don't see how I can ever be happy in a world that justifies this amount of senseless cruelty.

84,"AITA for ""converting"" my brother (11m) and myself (f17) to veganism? (r/vegan edition)","hello kind people of reddit,

i had a heated discussion with my parents yesterday and need some outside view on it. hope it's fine if i post here instead or r/aita because i don't think they would be too understanding about a kid x veganism.

some background info: I turned 95% vegan when I was 8-9 (I basically ate 1 sausage every 2 months) and stopped completely when I turned 13-14. Around a 1,5 years ago (when i ~15) I stopped drinking milk and replaced it with soy/oat milk. I also reduced all my other dairy/egg intake over the months. for the past months my breakfasts, the food I take to school and my dinner have been 100% vegan - but not lunch (which is something my mum makes. it usually includes milk, sometimes eggs).

I took a blood test around 2 months ago and my doc was ""devastated"" about my diet *ugh*.
she said I have to eat fish/meat 2x a week with dairy/eggs everyday (I have a b12/vit d deficiency at the moment). my parents - who have been really sceptical about vegans/vegetarians obviously used the results to blame me and to talk bad about me (check post history for some info). but my stance is that I prefer taking pills over supporting mass murder and rape. I can't imagine myself drinking milk or eating meat ever again. it's just wrong.

my brother (now 11), who watched documentaries in school talked to me about vegetarianism 1-1,5 years ago and after explaining my stance he decided to go vegetarian. my parents have been blaming me since then even though I never forced it onto him and always said it's his choice. he was the one curious about it.

well, I joined a really nice german vegan server which supported me and gave me food ideas for lunch for the past days (classes got cancelled so I had time) so I have been fully vegan for 5 days. I made rice with veggies, baked veggies&amp;potatoes, adapted more fruits to my breakfast etc.

yesterday I was trying out another recipe and my brother decided to tune in and help. We spent 4-5 hours together, prepping food, talking and: watching vids.

I showed him a ""I went vegan for 30 days"" vid, vids about veganism and we watched some gaming clips.
I dont know why. I thought he'd be interested since he is so open about it. we discussed it etc. He completely agreed but I told him not to talk about my parents about to it and to just continue his life as before (I knew they'd be furious). I suggested to him that he may try out my vegan yoghurt next time or to  that we could visit a vegan restaurant nearby (he wanted us to) and he seemed very hyped about it.

well, he is a kid. and he told them. he was sad about our soap being labelled ""milk and honey"" and enthusiastically told my parents about vegan butter which was more cheap. he told them all kinds of things in his little hype. what a cute little lad.

well my parents were furious (my dad way more than my mum), he called me and started screaming. he was about to explode and slammed the desk really bad. he called me selfish and horrible and said I dont decide about my diet until I turn 18 (in march).
He told me veganism is horribly unhealthy and I will suffer longterm effects from it and that it's a stupid trend. He threatened me with all kinds of punishments (taking my phone/pc) but I was the most scared about him hitting me (happens but very rarely).
the thing he was the most furious about was that I was ""converting"" my brother and forcing him into veganism. he said my brother will lack all kinds of vitamins and that he NEEDS milk&amp;egg since he is growing up. I know that this is NOT true but I also know that I won't be able to change his mind.

now I also know that my parents are just really worried about their son and I will talk to my brother about veganism today. I hope we can stick to the compromise I gave him yesterday. he continues his diet but tries out my vegan yoghurt or liverwurst from time to time. I hope if I do this I'll be allowed to stay on my vegan journey.
my parents will not care about facts or studies or anything. they are talking based on emotions.
in addition, my doc recommends an omnivore diet (-_-) and a health consultant.

was it wrong of me to show him 1-2 non graphic vids and talk to him about it? he was genuinely curious.
am I really that selfish? Does he need a non-vegan diet? he barely ate veggies&amp;fruits before but I told him that he needs them so he has been eating them more and more lately. what do I do now?

I am currently in school and I *do not* want to go home. If he forces milk onto me I will refuse and rather starve. Yesterday I wasn't able to express my thoughts but I feel like I fucked up.
Should I just have kept quiet?

I don't know what to do.
Should I also post this on AITA?

Recently I decided to start the journey towards becoming vegan and it's something I've attempted or considered before but would eventually find myself incredibly daunted at the thought of starting, and was also in a place with my family where I was living on their food and diets. Now I buy my own groceries and would like to move towards being healthier, and also living better! 

I know the mechanics of how to go vegan and already I eat mostly vegetarian but I still eat chicken. I've never been a fan of red meat in that way but already I've been sometimes at a loss when I look in the fridge to think about what to make for dinner! But I want to change that! 

I'm wondering if you guys had any helpful tips that can make the transition easier/make the cravings for meat less! Or what sneaky things to watch out for as well! Just yesterday I realised that I had to be more careful when buying sweet treats because I need to find alternatives for dairy and small things like that! I've gone on YouTube to learn about making meals and on how to feel full but it's still a rather daunting switch to make!

I'm also finding it hard to go outside with friends now! Recently when I was out with friends to celebrate a birthday, none of the meals were vegan and the only vegetarian option was an appetizer! I've never been a big eater but I still felt a little gypped because of it.

In fact, the fishing industry is just as bad. 

So if their money is still contributing to the problem, what really is the point? To say it’s for health reasons seems invalid, because dairy products are still bad, so it seems pointless to not just go all-in and be vegan. 

Whenever it’s come up that I’m vegan, I immediately get the “oh well I’m vegetarian!” It’s almost just as bad as the “I could NEVER give up meat!”, or (my favorite) “I barely eat meat”. 
Vegetarian and vegan are on a different spectrum. Vegetarians could waltz on into any Wendy’s and stuff their faces with a Wendy’s salad that’s smothered in cheese and ranch. The only connecting factor is not eating meat. I don’t think they realize how different it is to live a vegan lifestyle.

122,I realized my favourite pasta salad recipe is vegan!,"I have been trying to eat completely vegan since last january and just now realized that one of my all time favorite recipes is vegan, so I thought I would share. This has pretty much been my go to meal prep recipe for years because it's so simple to make and doesn't need any fancy ingredients, but is still super delicious. You need: 


-cherry tomatoes (about 500g) 
-one cucumber 
-2 cloves of garlic 
-black olives 
-500g pasta (I like the ones that look like clambs for this one because the stuff gets trapped in them, but you can use whatever...maybe not spaghetti) 
-fresh basil and chives (you can also use parsley) 
-olive oil 
-aceto balsamico (if you don't have access to a vegan option, you can use any vegan vinegar just adapt it so it doesn't get too sour)
-salt and pepper


1. While the water is heating up for the pasta you can chop tomatoes, cucumber and black olives into small pieces. Put into bowl. 
2. Put the two peeled garlic cloves together with the pasta into the boiling, salted water. Cook until al dente. It's ok if they still have some bite, it's better than if they are too soft! 
3. Mix olive oil and aceto together. I do half half, but the quantity depends on how much pasta I use. Add some salt and pepper. 
4. Chop the fresh herbs. 
5. When the pasta is ready separate it with a colander from the water. Then you can find the two garlic cloves that should now be soft from cooking and press them into the sauce. Add the still warm pasta to the cut veggies, add the chopped herbs and then pour in the sauce. Mix well and thats it!

It's really funny to me how vegans are always described as a pain in the ass or preachy, but really, it's impossible to even ask a question without being made to feel like you should feel bad for your life choices.

I’ve always made an effort not to hit ducks or squirrels with my car.  I would always try to capture lizards that got in my house and take them outside so they didn’t die. 

I just never called myself an animal lover. I never had any desire to volunteer for a shelter or anything, and I wasn’t particularly fascinated by animals at the zoo. I always thought eating animals was kind of sad, but was still the natural order of things. 

So anyway, I became vegan for health reasons 3 years ago, at age 35. I have since become an ethical vegan. If I had to kill an animal to survive, I would, but I don’t see any reason to hurt them otherwise - especially when I’m healthier not eating animal products. And I’m horrified that I ate them for so long without realizing how terrible it was.

I’ve seen a few people online joke about how the series is referencing climate change (&gt;!via the Darkening!&lt;), and how the Skeksis are politicians in that regard. What I’m seeing is that the Skeksis are like meat eaters, &gt;!as they consume gelfling and podling essence!&lt;, and the podlings and geflings are vegans, as they eat moss and etc. They are also said to be closest to nature (&gt;!thra!&lt;) and the planet.

185,Raising vegan kids with nonvegan peers?,"Hi there! To preface- I’m not a bioparent I’m a stepparent to a kid that wants to be vegan. She’s almost 8 and very adamantly does not want to eat animals- her dad and I are vegan, her mom is a former vegan (now pescatarian I think?) but is still making her eat chicken and turkey and such at her house, despite not eating it herself. Upsetting, but out of our jurisdiction. So we just keep our diet here and don’t talk about what she’s made to eat there unless she wants to talk about it. She wants to be vegan here, (she’s mostly vegan here already for the past 3 ish years) but still occasionally has snacks with dairy. The older she gets the more passionate about it she becomes! 

Issues we’re running into- aside from the other parents house/family, her peers are often kind of weird or rude about her not wanting to eat animals. For instance, last year around this time, they went to a pumpkin patch for a field trip. Sounds perfectly vegan friendly! It wasn’t. Apparently there were pigs on the farm, and a good bit of discussion about bacon. This awesome little girl of ours wasn’t shy to speak her truth, but was met with much judgment from her peers and no backup from the adults in the situation. That’s just one example, really..

So I guess, what I’m asking is, how have you guys helped young aspiring vegan/vegetarians to cope with the world telling them they’re wrong, in age appropriate ways?

194,Serious question (to me anyway): biofuels based in part on animal fat,"Hi folks, here is a serious question, at least in my mind: we all know that petro fuels can be seriously bad for the environment.  Many people become vegans for almost the same reason that other people switch to taking the bus or riding a bike instead of driving a car: to reduce environmental impact.  

But what about this?  Suppose we could all switch to biologically-sourced fuels for our cars, trucks, or whatever, BUT ALSO suppose that this biofuel had some animal-based content to it?  

I'm referring to one type of biodiesel that is looking more and more viable as a replacement for petroleum diesel -- similar energy content, but without the potential to wreck rubber hoses and fittings and eat fuel filters -- and that is actually commercially available in increasing quantities.  In addition, they say it is more stable and actually usable in cold climates.  This fuel is called R99, and it's made from a mixture of vegetable oils and animal fats.  

The ethics of biofuels are complicated.  Ideally, vegetable oils would be recycled so as to not impact food availability.  In addition, vegetable-based oils result from plant production, and plants are generally good for the atmosphere.  But animal fat-based fuel?  Or even partially based on animal fats?  

If we quit eating animals (in part) to avoid bad environmental impacts, but it turns out that ONE PART of the animal results in good environmental impacts, does that make it more OK?  What about people (like myself) who consider themselves ethical vegans?  I don't wear any leather because buying leather is part of the economic process of killing animals.  What about driving my work truck using oil that is obtained from the same animals that I didn't want to be killed in the last sentence when it came to my choice of footwear?  

I would love to hear some perspectives, and I'm hoping this may help me figure out how I feel about this.  In the meantime, a couple of interesting links:

I've been looking at food for her and most seem to be geared towards increasing egg production. We do not eat eggs and I plan on feeding them back to her as a treat. She appears to be fairly young and currently roosts in one of our trees. She only stays in our yard and has become accustomed to my husband and I and have started running towards us for food.

235,Carnivore here. Want to try again vegan just for science.,"&amp;#x200B;

I eat mostly raw meat, and eggs, from well raised free animals, or grass fed. I also eat occasionally fruits, and very rarely some rice. And thats it. My body does not tolerate anything else.

Everytime i tried a vegan diet my health deteriorated. I believe veganism is good only for some people, and in some situations.

I always lost muscle mass, energy, and got depression. Thats what i can attribute to the lack of animal products in my diet.

But i also got allergic reactions to most vegetables, grains and some fruits. Fruits are good for the most. As for those other issues i dont necessarily blame veganism for it.

So it seems people like me have no other choice than eating meat, if not at least seasonally. But still i want to try it one more time, to see the effect will be the same.

The reason why i want to try it again, is because in the past when i did juicing for a few days, i felt some benefits. But i dont think that can be attributed to veganism, but the fact i was fasting for the most.

However, since i dont tolerate most vegetables. I can only eat rice, and fruits, because everything else will cause terrible symptoms in the short term and illness in the long term. I think that is quite restrictive. But ill see what happens just for a few days.

240,Vegans are like reminders for others about how immoral their lifestyle is,"That's why they get so mad. They don't wanna see themselves as bad, it's the number 1 enemy of the ego. Some turn vegan but most end up justifying it and if they make us vegans look bad, they can feel good about doing their immoral acts. Deep inside they know what they're doing is wrong that's why they're so mad at us and like to make fun of us. So don't let these people tear you down, guys. We have that cognitive dissonance and weight off our shoulders. We can look at animals and love them without somewhere in our subconscious feeling guilt and shame about how we actually treat them.
Whenever you get backlash from meat eaters just pity their narrow minded brains and unwillingness to change. Their laziness and selfishness.

I need some meal ideas that won't draw too much attention (sounds bad I know) but I have a nearly 3 year old who quite often only eats the meat on his plate and leaves the rest and has only just started eating one unprocessed vegetable very recently which is carrot. I also have my partner who is not particularly compassionate when it comes to animals, he doesn't want to inflict unnecessary pain (as far as a meat eater can say that) but he doesn't like them even when they're alive, he thinks they're smelly and stupid. And then there's me who really wants to make the change but I always run out of steam a few weeks in.

I'm looking for meals that aren't noticablely lacking in meat, I'm not a fan of fake meats or things that are there as a replacement. So far I can only think of vegetable soups and stews, jacket potatoes and meat free pasta bakes, does anyone have any other ideas?

Oh and one more awkward thing we're not a fan of Mexican food, when I've asked for meal ideas on Reddit before a lot of Americans answer and you guys love your Mexican food lol. We don't eat a lot of Mexican food in England so we don't have a lot of options in the supermarkets and I don't know how to cook that kind of thing, I've tried before but it didn't taste nice, maybe it's just me or maybe we just don't like Mexican, I'm not sure.

244,Question to my Vegan Friends about my Vegan Children's Book.,"Hey Vegan Fam. So I just created a vegan children's book because I noticed so many books talk about meat and animal products like its no big deal. I published with amazon who doesn't have a vegan category for children and I couldn't  list it under cook book categories. The best thing I could think about was to put a vegan logo on the cover which is also the logo to my vegan website. Hopefully that will let vegans know that this book is vegan friendly. Has anyone else had this experience, and do you think it will be enough to get the attention of Vegan readers? Anyway I apologise if this is posted in the wrong section, I didn't know where else to post it. I am giving my ebook away for free on amazon until Thursday, if you want to read it and give me some feedback I would greatly appreciate it. I know the art is a bit amateurish because I am a beginner, but I am already working on my 2nd vegan book and my art is improving greatly. If you are interested in reading it for free on the kindle, here is the amazon link.

252,Today is My Second Veganniversary!,"Two years ago today, after thinking and learning about veganism for years, I took the plunge and have never looked back. Then 50 and diabetic, I made the move for health reasons, in a fit of pique over frustration with my physical well-being. Since that time, owing in no small part to this beautiful community, my heart has grown ever more tender for animals and their well-being and my environmentalism, a long and sustaining commitment, has deepened and broadened.

So two years later, the results have been life-giving and fulfilling. Countless animals have been allowed to live, death-centered industries and enterprises have not been supported, acres have not been cleared and have remained forested. And my health has substantially improved: my diabetes is under much better control than it was before, and I have been able to stop taking all three diabetes pills I used to take. Still insulin-dependent, although that has reduced significantly, above and beyond stopping those pills.

On this anniversary, I commit to increasing my efforts to spread veganism and its ideals and principles and the facts which support it, which are legion. I commit to stepping up my efforts to improve my own health, with the goal of increasing my significant weight loss in hope of becoming ever less diabetic. My body needs that! 

And I commit to reaching within and opening up and being in touch with my feelings, both in the positive and the negative. Owning pain and acknowledging it, embracing love, sharing and celebrating it. And ever being open to learning and expanding awareness and understanding. Thank you, vegan friends, for so kindly and beautifully helping me along this path so often. ❤️🌱☀️",vegan,WeHaSaulFan,1567506283,4,True,2019-09-03

1. Commented on each of the instagram posts (probably twice each, liked other comments calling them out for animal cruelty  and there's a decent amount of posts advertising these ugly cruel items. I cannot comment on the new ones though as commenting is limited)
2. Tagged them in an instagram story which they have seen 
3. Messaged them on instagram I said 

""Why did you turn off commenting? Is it because you know your choices are unethical and wrong?

I strayed when I was anemic (pregnancy related, got infusions, fine now) and since then have only gone downhill. I moved for husband's work but we'll be moving back soon, thank goodness.

I'm not sure what I'm asking and I'm having a hard time articulating, but maybe an app that takes my ingredients and helps me meal prep? Or tracks my ingredient usage and alerts me to when I need to head to the store?

From what he's told, Lark (mother dog) got impregnated while she was at a doggy daycare facility and they have no idea who the father is. This would mean that Lark was unsupervised with other unfixed dogs for at the least 30 minutes. It seems like a doggy daycare would have to be crazy incompetent for something like this to occur. I find this story very implausible and it's more likely he backyard bred his dog and fabricated this story to avoid judgement.

Seems silly to just throw out a perfectly good food item, but am also reluctant to eat something containing milk, eggs and whey. (It's strange to feel that way since a couple years ago I wouldn't have given it a second thought.)


I'm wondering if anyone here has any thoughts on the subject.


As for specifics, here in Australia one of our major supermarkets, Coles, has started putting their Christmas puddings out on shelves.


I stopped by on my way home from work to buy some bread and other stuff, and decided to buy a matured Christmas pudding while I was there.


That *specific* type of pudding is vegan, I've bought them a couple of times before. The package even has a very distinctive vegan logo on it. A light-green square with a large dark-green ""V"" on it, and a dark-green stripe along the bottom with the word ""vegan"" on it in small white letters.


But as I was putting it into my basket I noticed a chocolate Christmas pudding next to it, I didn't remember seeing them last year so assumed the must be new. It had exactly the same green ""V"" logo on it as the vegan pudding I was already buying so I thought I'd get that too and give it a try sometime.


It wasn't until after I got home that I noticed that the small white text under the ""V"" said *vegetarian* instead of *vegan*. Looking at the ingredients it has milk eggs and whey.

493,Anyone have experience with Will's Vegan Shoes?,"I have one pair of their white NY sneakers, and they're not holding up that well. However, I'm not sure if that's just because they're white sneakers, which always age roughly, or if it's a deeper structural problem. Has anyone had experience with their boots, like [these](https://wills-vegan-store.com/vegan-work-boots-mens-chestnut.html
), for example? Do they hold up well for more than a year? How do they do in snow and rain?

Thank you!",vegan,OMR95,1567610074,3,True,2019-09-04
