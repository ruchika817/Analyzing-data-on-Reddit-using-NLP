Just got into an argument at work about my diet...,"Hi all. So I kinda fit here not really. I‚Äôm pescatarian but for 2020 I want to make the switch to vegetarian and then vegan hopefully. Anyway, my coworker found out and asked if I would cook meat for my bf and I said no I‚Äôm not going to give money to that industry blah blah. He then went on to say giving the dead animal money is honoring them so they don‚Äôt go to waste. 

My argument was I don‚Äôt care giving my dollar still gives the industry money and power to continue what they‚Äôre doing and not just ‚Äúhonoring‚Äù a dead animal, whatever that means...

Then he said none of us vegetarians/vegans matter we are nobody and the meat industry will always be powerful and I‚Äôm already frustrated enough being a waitress and I really didn‚Äôt need to be having this conversation so I just stayed quiet.

Honest questions from a former vegetarian,"I started out as a ""reducatarian"" a few years ago. As a I learnt more about animal welfare, how animal agriculture affects climate, and the health benefits of replacing animal sourced foods with plant base options, I became vegetarian and last year made the jump to vegan.

With all the infighting and puritanical screaming at each other that goes around online, I took me all year to be able to confidently say: ""I'm vegan."". I see a lot of negative parallels with the hardcore religious people I was surrounded by growing up. (Where all answers are in black and white an no grey area's exists.)

Eventually I made the conclusion for myself that it wasn't about being at a certain level but about learning, growing, educating myself and changing my habits and actions accordingly. And this is where my question comes into play. Having grown up on and surrounded by dairy farms it was kind of a shock to start understanding what really goes on. But once I came to that realization it was fairly easy to let go of dairy based products. My question to you is (if applicable): How do you deal with this knowledge and not work towards eliminating animal sourced products. Or is this not the case and do most members of this sub think they'll eventually become more vegan?",vegetarian,tukkerdees,1577805734,5,True,2019-12-31

Frustrations as a vegetarian?,"Let me start by saying I am not a vegetarian. However, I do tend to tend to go for vegetarian options when available. I do not like most meats due to taste, texture, and/or appearance reasons. As I have been sorta dabbling with a primarily veggie diet, I have noticed more people reacting or judging what I like and it is a bit frustrating. 

&amp;#x200B;

For instance, I travel in a group for work and it is common for us to stop at food outlets. I usually aim for vegetarian options, especially since I do not like being too filled up for a manual labor job. Almost every time I order a vegetarian option, my coworkers with something along the lines of ""Eww,"" or ""That is gross."" Usually something that is a more-so negative 2-cents of theirs. This is also common during events like parties and family functions.

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever I'm with family, the same thing happens. On one hand, it is kinda worse because I still eat with my family at the table; do not get to pick what is being served. I often find myself having to eat meats I am not to fond of, or picking things out like bacon-bits and whatnot. It happens in social situations such as parties too, and I feel guilty for not accepting food offers. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel as if a lot of people assume what you like, and sometimes even display some type of repulse. It is a pet peeve of mine when I am offered food, politely turn it down, get asked why I declined, mention that it is not for me, and get a some kinda condescending response. For example, I cannot stand hot dogs or bacon and it is very common to see them around at parties. I feel like people insist to eat it but refuse to believe what I actually like, even after telling them several times. As if my tastebuds have magically changed overnight. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I was a more frequent meat eater, I felt like this was never an issue. There were some little disagreements here-and -there, but now it is very common in my everyday life. Have many of you vegetarians experienced similar frustrations?",vegetarian,Trapp3dIn3D,1577839969,1,True,2019-12-31

Can you eat too much hummus?,"I've recently been eating little to no dairy in an attempt to clear up my awful adult acne. (Results are so far inconclusive on that front but it's only been a few weeks). But anyway, I've started eating hummus as kind of a replacement.

I usually get the store bought variety, though I realize homemade would probably be healthier. I know hummus in itself isn't *bad* but I feel like I eat it excessively.

Is there such a thing as too much soy?,"So I've been cutting down on meat for the past 6 months and have decided to become completely vegetarian for 2020.

However I'm kind of worried that my diet may not be healthy as I eat tofu for almost every meal as it's the easiest thing for me to cook with the limited space in my home.

A normal day for me would be.

Breakfast: 2 eggs and 2 egg whites

Lunch: 200 grams tofu 1/2 ton kidney beans 250 grams mixed veg

Dinner: 200 grams tofu 1/2 ton kidney beans 250 grams mixed veg

Snacks: 1 liter soy milk, 64 grams whey, 30 grams popcorn

This is what I normally eat on the days I'm in work as I do 14 hour shifts and cant do meal prep so all I have to work with really is a microwave and a george Forman and in all honesty I dont get board eating just this.

Why is soy milk so controversial?,"It's been around the longest of all the plant milk alternatives. I remember being a kid and soya (I'm UK) milk was the only one you could buy. I've been a fan of soya milk for a long time, and probably switched over to non-dairy milk entirely four of so years ago. As far as I'm concerned, soya still holds the top spot (joint with oat milk) for simply tasting the best all round - to me it's traditionally been the only one that tastes 'right' in a cup of tea for example, striking the right balance between sweetness and creaminess. If you're:

A. British
B. Used to drinking tea with dairy milk

Then you're probably familiar with how a traditional cup of tea 'should' taste. Now I can't speak for everyone but certain milks just taste plain wrong to me in tea: almond generally doesn't taste sweet, or creamy enough, and doesn't mimic the flavour of real milk closely - hazelnut is creamy, but again not sweet enough, and has an odd flavour profile for tea - coconut milk just tastes plain *wrong* and is my least favourite. I can leave rice milk and hemp milk. I love cashew milk, however, and it's also probably the most similar-looking alternative to the real thing.

What are your thoughts on soya milk, and why is it that so many people I talk to in real life have an opposition to it? I will say...I understand that soya is, not the friendliest product to the environment. Despite this though. the inexpensive price, and taste profile of soya milk, make it my go-to.",vegetarian,ChurKirby,1577895790,15,True,2020-01-01

AITA for refusing to pick chicken out of my pasta,"For background I have been a vegetarian for 4 years now and as anyone here knows it means quite a lot(to me anyway). I‚Äôm not high and mighty about what I eat and I never deign to tell anyone else what to eat.

Tonight I ordered takeaway pasta with my family  as we always do on Wednesday nights. The pasta I usually get is vegetarian but has the extra option of adding chicken for meat eaters. I ordered over the phone and when the food arrived my pasta had chicken in it. By coincidence the pasta my mother ordered was vegetarian so I asked if she would be willing to switch with me. She has ordered my pasta with the chicken before and enjoyed it so it wasn‚Äôt something completely outlandish. Alternatively I offered to make myself something else seeing as I didn‚Äôt want her to feel obligated to accommodate me.

She told me to just pick out the chicken from my pasta and couldn‚Äôt understand why I refused to do that. She told me that me and my ‚Äúnonsense‚Äù (vegetarianism) are making life difficult for everyone around me and that I was being selfish. She then made me switch with her and ate almost nothing.

Update: 1 year meat free,"[Previous Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/am1zvk/its_been_1_month_lost_five_pounds_saved_90_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Tl;dr of previous post is that my daughter wanted to challenge herself to a year of pescatarianism.  

Well, today is officially a full year. She freaking did it. Not a single (knowing) slip up. She went an entire year without eating meat just because she wanted to see if she could. I shouldn‚Äôt be a surprised as I am since I know she‚Äôs a hard headed, strong willed young woman. But I‚Äôm still blown away. 

A few notes about the year. 

- The biggest thing is how much my grocery budget has shrunk. Meat is fucking expensive. Vegetables are not nearly as costly and it *really* helps even more when you grow your own (/#blessed). 

- My two teenage boys haven‚Äôt missed it at all. They aren‚Äôt pescatarian and eat meat when they want it (at school, when we go out to eat, etc). They give her a hard time but that is more being siblings that tease each other than actually having any negative feelings toward it. 

- At about 6 months in, we did start using/experimenting with some meat analogs. That was about the time we had an Impossible Burger the first time. That thing is a-maz-ing. We had it at Busch Gardens and when she first bit into it, she started crying because she thought she‚Äôd accidentally been given a ground beef burger and was incredibly upset. I took a bite and almost went full Karen (or whatever the dude version of Karen is). I honestly prefer that to regular burger now partly because I don‚Äôt feel gross after eating it. 

- Our meals have become a lot more creative. We have always eaten well (I was a chef for 25 years before changing careers). But it was easy to fall into the work week routine of making the same dishes over and over. We did have some nights where we scrapped the meal and ordered pizza because I screwed it up, we didn‚Äôt care for it, or something like that. But overall we have had a lot of fun experimenting. 

- (This is probably preaching to the choir) I was absolutely blown away at the quality of vegetarian offerings at grocery stores. There is so much great stuff out there! 

- (This is *definitely* preaching to the choir) There are some truly shitty people out there. I have had to jump dead in some strangers asses (and a family member) for berating a 15/16 year old child for her dietary choices. Like, seriously, What. The. Fuck?! Our dietary choices are absolutely none of your fucking business. They don‚Äôt affect you in any way. She is *obviously* healthy, active, and all of her nutritional needs are being met. Her doctor recommended a multivitamin but is incredibly happy with all 3 of the kids health. Who the fuck do these people think they are and where the fuck do they get off talking to *children* like that?!

- I didn‚Äôt make any announcements or anything but 90% of Thanksgiving and Christmas meals were vegetarian. We had 10 quite committed and vocal carnivores over and they cleaned up. Said it was the best food they‚Äôd had. Imagine their Shocked Pikachu  face when I told them the only things that had meat in them was the turkey and ham. /#winning

It‚Äôs been a great year. I‚Äôve asked her if she‚Äôs going to revert back but she isn‚Äôt inclined to at this point. She has (well founded) concerns about getting sick after not eating meat for so long and said the only things she really misses is bacon and turkey at the holidays. We experimented with the veggie roasts and stuff but we just aren‚Äôt fans (one of the meals that went in the trash). 

To wrap up, I‚Äôd say this is a bit of a brag but also to say that a transition to a vegetarian lifestyle is attainable even in a rural community. I‚Äôm sure I forgot to add something so please feel to ask anything.",vegetarian,bubbleheadbob2000,1577917379,28,True,2020-01-01

Vegetarian uni meals,"Hi all, 
I‚Äôm going to be attending my second year of university this year and am a little lost on what meals to cook/make for lunch and dinner. I will have a budget of $20-30 each week and will mostly be focusing on vegetables &amp; fruits. A local vegetable shop provides free delivery at an affordable price within my budget so I‚Äôm going to take full advantage of that. 

These are some vegetables and fruits that I like to consume ~
‚Ä¢ Vegetables: Potato, celery, tomato, carrot, capsicum and peppers, green onion, broccoli, cucumber, red onions, spinach 
* Fruits: I like all fruits and am happy with any type of fruit that is available 

Other than fruits/vegetables I also intend to shop at my local supermarket for rice, nacho chips, cheese, and other foods that I like that would take too long to mention here fully. 

So anyways, I was wondering if anyone on this sub has some good recipes for focusing solely on vegetables. (Additions can include rice and other affordable foods for a student)

Something that is appealing to me is vegetable stirfry but I don‚Äôt want to make that every single day. 

I‚Äôm also thinking about setting aside one day of the week for meal prepping and chopping up my vegetables and storing them in the freezer for use immediately as the week goes on. 
So meal prep tips and the appropriate storing methods of the vegetables I mentioned above would be much appreciated:) 

Thank you all!!

Feeling so much lighter and happier since going vego!!,"I‚Äôve been wanting to stop eating meat for the longest time but I come from a family of carnivores I swear if it breathes/ walks/ swims we‚Äôll eat it.

Working for restaurant mainly meat producing,"So I went veggie about September time, just after the Amazon rainforest fires, and during summer I applied for a job at a restaurant that mainly serves meat, on bone and off.

However now I am feeling distressed, and torn about my situation. Two of the managers have said it's counterproductive or hypocritical to work here and in my mind j feel like I'm supporting/helping eat meat when I also believe that less meat needs to be eaten and the corporation's need to stop so much.

I tried Beyond Meat sausage at Hardee's - They scraped the grills.,"I know this is anecdotal and will only concern certain peoples but as I was waiting for my meal (I ordered a Frisco Breakfast Sandwich with Beyond Sausage instead of ham) I overheard the kitchen manager instructing her staff on the preparation of the sausage. One of the things that stood out was she was telling a story of a friend of hers that had the Impossible Burger at Burger King the other day and became sick. She said the reason was that her friend was allergic to meat and the Impossible Burger had flecks of meat from the grill on the sandwich which in turn made her sick when she unknowingly ate them. She then told her staff, ""...and this is why they said to make sure to thoroughly scrape the grill clean before you cook the Beyond Sausage, and use the designated spatula.""

The kitchen didn't know I could hear them from the counter but I asked the cashier when she brought me my food to please let the manager know that I overheard what she said and I thank her for being so considerate.

I've been requested to do an elimination diet and not been able to talk to a dietician. Can I pick r/vegetarian's brains on some things?,"TLDR: have to cut out all nuts, soy produce, most dairy, most yeast preparations. Can't eat Quorn. What are my options for the protein/satisfying part of my meal?

DISCLAIMER: Not a vegetarian. Over half my meals are in line with a lacto-ovo vegetarian diet anyway though, so I'm not a 'peel my cold dead fingers off mah burger' person.

This morning I was handed a list of foods during an health appointment. I need to eliminate them all for 3 months and then introduce them back one at a time. The person I saw was not a dietician so they weren't able to help with any meal planning. After being told to research the diet to work out more detailed information (like 'nuts' was listed. Is that all nuts? Tree nuts? Ground nuts? Turns out it was ALL nuts, peanuts and sesame seeds tooüò≠) I've worked out I'm being asked to have a low Tryamine diet. 

I am really struggling for 'main' elements for dishes. I can have lean, unprocessed meat but it's expensive and boring/annoying to cook all the time. I used to eat a fair amount of soya mince, soya meat etc. I'd eat Quorn but it gives me diarrhea. 

The only thing I can think of to use is pulses. I'm just struggling to come up with a variety of things to eat, that I can cook while herding rambunctious children and aren't difficult to get hold of. I need to get in as much variety as possible as other people I cook for easily go off of food for aaaaages after I've cooked it too much. I was working on a 3 week meal plan with no repeats.

Eating at BK in the US,"How to use ""Whopper"" coupons:

You probably know that Burger King has 2 veg sandwich options. There is the original, a healthy-ish Morning Star Farms garden veggie patty, and then of course, the delicious but maybe less healthy(?) Impossible Whopper.

My story- when receiving BK coupon mailers. I began asking to sub the original Whopper for the Impossible at the store. Initially, this worked and I was very happy. Then they started up charging me a dollar for each Impossible Whopper sometimes. I felt like there was poor training of employees around the subject so each did things differently. Eventually though, my local stores entirely stopped accepting the coupons because ""it says right on the coupon, no substitutions (true) and we were trained not to accept these for use on Impossible Whopper"". I asked if they could be used on the original veggie burger and was told ""no"".

My most recent visit, I asked if the coupons were totally useless to a vegetarian and was told basically, yes. Their veggie burger was nowhere to be found on the menu but I asked about the old veggie burger. Apparently it's called the ""Veggie Whopper"" now and when I heard that I asked ""can I use..."" the whopper coupon for a ""veggie whopper""? 

The answer is YES, you can use Whopper coupons on the ""veggie whopper""s. Just make sure you call it that, because again, it is obvious their training on such issues wasn't thorough for all employees.

Experiences with zero-waste vegetarianism?,"Hey guys! Sorry if this is something answered in beginner questions or the FAQ - I'm tired and might not've noticed it when I looked over the lists. 

With the new year started up and all, one of my goals for 2020 is to try and produce less waste - ESPECIALLY food waste and the packaging that comes with it. Do any of you have experience with a zero-waste (or, honestly, just ""lesser""-waste) vegetarian lifestyle and are willing to share some tips? There's a co-op in my town that sells things like grains, oils, nut butter, etc. in bulk, so I think I'll invest in some good containers and start there...but I'm a little worried about how to buy dairy products/replacements or tofu or, well, stuff that normally comes in packaging.

Wanting to go fully vegetarian but am worried as my SO has an eating disorder and don't want to make it worse. Any advice?,"Hey all, 

I cook all the meals (I'm an ex chef) and my SO has been very ok and supportive of us having multiple meatless meals in a week. However, whenever I bring up being a full veggie my SO's little eating disorder behaviours come back. 

My SO is in active recovery from her ED and I don't want to make this any worse. 

The place we purchase the meat she eats is local and while I (mainly due to my past work) understand the ethical issues of meat consumption, the environmental impact is the biggest motivator for me. The environment is a big concern to my SO as well, but removing things from her diet is very difficult as it starts up all the ED thoughts.

What I will most likely do is just be vegetarian and just cook her a meal with meat in it if she would like. But I was wondering if anyone else out there has any similar experiences or advice?

Was fed meat at a restaurant without knowing - Advice needed,"Hi, I just joined this community to make this post. I didn‚Äôt know it existed until now honestly, I don‚Äôt use reddit often, but I need advice.

I have been vegetarian for over three years. My family eats meat. We are all currently on vacation in Hawaii and have been here for about seven days.

I am vegetarian because of the ethics. I think it is wrong to eat animals. I understand that this is not a shared belief by a lot of people, but I strongly believe this.

On day one of my vacation, we went to a nearby ramen place to our hotel. On their menu, they had a miso vegetable ramen that looked good so we decided to go in. My family always eats somewhere where there are options for me, because we like to go and eat places together. 

We go in and ask the waitress if the miso vegetable ramen was vegetarian, and she said it had a pork broth. I said ok, that‚Äôs okay I can just not eat/get sides. The waitress then says that they have a new tomato ramen that had a tomato soup base without meat. I try it and it was great. 

Tonight, my family decided to go back because we thought it was good the last time. I order the tomato ramen again and double check that it is vegetarian, and turns out it was beef based.

When I found this out, I have a complete breakdown in the restaurant. I couldn‚Äôt help myself from crying and I start having a panic attack where I couldn‚Äôt feel my arms or legs. Other people in the restaurant started looking and the people sitting next to us tried to comfort me but I just couldn‚Äôt stop from crying. 

The waitress lectures me about how I should know Japanese ramen is never vegetarian. My family started arguing with the staff on my behalf saying that the waitress that first day said explicitly that there was no meat in the broth. 

We left the restaurant for the hotel and I have been crying the whole way over. I am currently in the bathroom crying. 

I‚Äôm thinking myself in circles right now. I have felt bloated and sick (acid reflux) all week even though I don‚Äôt have a history of acid reflux. I am typically pretty skinny and my stomach has been sticking out looking like I am pregnant for a whole week now. I can‚Äôt help but think this is why. 

I need help coping. Beef is the animal I feel the most strongly about ethics-wise. I need help calming down and figuring out what to do next. Although my family is trying to comfort me they don‚Äôt understand what it‚Äôs like. I need advice from other vegetarians. 

Tl;dr Was fed beef broth when I was told it was vegetarian. Found out when I went back a week later. I am having trouble coping and need advice.",vegetarian,helpmethrow-awayyyyy,1578126030,30,True,2020-01-04
I told my parents that I'm going vegetarian and I think they think lower of me now. I'm devastated.,"So I've been living almost as a vegetarian for about a year and a half by now. The only occasion that I ate meat was when we were eating out or when I was at my parents or grandparents. But recently I cut out all meat and I was feeling great, and I was really proud of me for once.

Then came the holidays and with it loads and loads of food. My dad and my grandfather love cooking and they always cook with meat. I honestly think they've never eaten a vegetarian meal in their lives. They always say that they can't eat salad or raw vegetables because they mess up their digestion, so the side dishes are mostly cooked potatoes or cauliflower with bacon or something. So of course, this holidays, as always, there's meat with meat with meat with a side of meat. And being a good and polite child I of course at it. But my stomach wasn't too happy about it. I had cramps almost everyday during that time and I felt really bad and ashamed for some reason. I despised myself for every bite I took. But I didn't want to offend my family by not eating.

After the holidays I got to think about whether I wanted to carry on like this or just go full vegetarian and tell my parents. It was a really hard decision because since I can remember my family never thought highly about vegans and vegetarians, mocking and being disrespectful towards their lifestyle. Being like ""why buy products that taste like meat when you are vegetarian. If you crave it that bad just buy a peace of nice pig!"" or (during dinner) ""thank God that we never had one of the girls bring home a vegetarian that would ruin this lovely meal for us"". And I just sat there in silence not saying anything.

So fast forward to yesterday. I told my mom that I would like to go full vegetarian, and she was somewhat respectful of my decision (but I never worried about her, she's always been really supportive, my main concern was my father who lives for meat), maybe voicing some concerns about malnutrition, but I explained to her that that isn't a problem anymore in this time and age so she was like ""whatever, if it makes you happy"". I told her not to tell my dad because I wasn't ready yet but she did anyways, but she only told me that she did this morning. Looking back, he actually made something for dinner yesterday that we both could enjoy (that meat was separated from the other stuff so I could actually eat something.

So I took my odds and confronted my dad. It was really really hard for me because I've been struggling to get his approval all my life, and with this decision I think I never will. I told him that I wanted to live as a vegetarian for health reasons, as well as ethical and environmental. I could already see the disapproval in his eyes so I added ""maybe I'll eat meat when I'm here over the weekend every other month, but I can't tell yet for sure"". He told me that he didn't approve of my decision, saying that living vegetarian is not environmentally above eating meat because of the pollution during transport (we live in Europe so somewhat of a fail point if I was to eat mangos everyday) and that being vegetarian isn't a lifestyle for him but political extremism. Like being a far right extremist. And that he only eats meat from animals that have lived ""happily"" and that I could do the same. He told me being vegetarian for ethical reasons would be jumping the bandwagon because of all the environmental extremism going on right now and that I don't think myself if I do it.

So yeah. I mean I am studying biology and am really environmentally conscious, but I really don't see his point. So it tried calming him down saying I'm not trying to change his lifestyle, it's only something I'm doing for myself, and that he can continue cooking whatever he pleases as long as there's maybe a side without meat.

That was the end of the conversation, because my mom walked into the room and we just stopped talking. I really don't know what to do, I know he doesn't approve of my decision. Has anyone had a similar experience and know some sort of way to make him understand?

Sorry for the long post and the rambling, I just had to get it of my mind and thought some of you might have some advice. Also sorry for typos or grammatical errors in general, English is not my primary language.

Thank you for any advice!

Edit: thank all of you for your kind advice! I see now that (as u/GhostGecko2 suggested) there's no point in trying to ""make him understand"" because he is entitled to an opinion on this matter as much as I am. I hope in time he and my grandparents will see that I'm happy with my decision and come to respect me for it.

I‚Äôm a self proclaimed vegetarian but I‚Äôll eat meat on special occasions. My family and some friends give me shit for it - how do you deal?,"**ETA I don‚Äôt flaunt that I‚Äôm veg, it‚Äôs just known about me to my family and friends** 

So I recently went back to being veg after taking a year ish break (prior to this I was veg for a year). I avoid meat for purely environmental reasons, and honestly I don‚Äôt really care about the animal welfare side of things. Call me a bad person, whatever. My choice. Anyway. 

Because of my reasons for going veg in the first place I allow myself a treat every now and then. For example, if I‚Äôm at a specialty restaurant and I‚Äôm not a fan of their vegetarian option. Like this restaurant I just went to that had AMAZING reviews for their Cuban sandwich only had a portobello mushroom thing as a vegetarian option. I hate portobellos and I didn‚Äôt want to eat fries and a side veggie, so I let myself have the Cuban sandwich. It was great! I also had some fish meals because I‚Äôm on a trip to key west so of course the fish is prime. 

I‚Äôm entirely content with my choices and I feel zero guilt from myself. However, my family seems to like to point out every time I eat meat. ‚ÄúOh yea, issajulia the vegetarian is having meat now huh??‚Äù and they just make me feel guilty for it. I‚Äôve explained my rationale. I‚Äôve asked them to stop. But they just like to pick on me so much about it and it‚Äôs wearing me down. I don‚Äôt want to sulk with a meal I don‚Äôt even like or my sixth veggie burger of the last 4 days just so I don‚Äôt have to deal with them. Rarely my friends will also make comments about when I eat meat. 

Is there something more effective I should be saying to get them to stop, or am i doomed to resorting to ignoring them?

A little Monday think tank,"Hi!

I'm a pescaterian and have been for a couple of months. It's going pretty easy for me at the minute but I'm taking things slow. I've switched before and gone full vegan or vegetarian and kind of hit a wall both times so I'm doing it less gung ho this time around.

But my post isn't about that.

I'm a part of a couple of chat groups, one of which started talking about vegetarianism and it's impact on the world. If it really matters if we all switch from a meat based diet to a plant based. One of my friends works for a company that's deep in the food industry, with machinery and such.

He had a couple of interesting points that I just have to admit that I can't refute since I don't have any reference or knowledge to do so. So if it's okay (and I know some of you have probably answered this in your own life or on here before but bare with me) I'd like to pass some of his points along:

&amp;#x200B;

1. If everybody would switch to a plant based diet the carbon emissions world wide would only be lowered by aprox 2,5%. That included everything, farm land, animal food etc.
2. That would mean that 1/2 of the lowest 1/4 of the population would lose their jobs.
3. That's why no African country has any interest in ""printing food"", i.e. producing clean meat or high protein veggie products. The land is too valuable.
4. 80% of the lowest income people work in agriculture, he guessed that about 90% of that focused on animal proteins.
5. The land or products produced for animals are in large parts not suitable for human consumption.

Am I the only one that hasn't noticed a difference in how good I feel between times I've been vegetarian and when I had meat in my diet (approx 90% meat free),"I hear a lot of people who switch to veganism or vegetarianism exalt about how great they've felt not eating meat etc, how they've noticed such a difference in energy levels.. however I've never felt that difference, why is that?

Soy increases estrogen in men?,"Okay i read it says no it does not increase estrogen. But it does mimic the estrogen receptors so it gives the same effects. Heard also that in normal amount the effects are close to none noticeable. But in high amounts it has been proven that it does in fact decrease testosterone and that some people themselves have reported developing gynecomastia from high soy diet. And once they stopped and surgically removed the gynecomastia the problem did not return. (This was from eating chicken with lots of soy sauce according to victim)

This post is of course not a post to berate vegetarians. I personally believe a vegan diet can and is healthy in many ways. Of course this does not mean it doesn‚Äôt have any flaws. The reason for making this post was because of a friend telling me it does not increase estrogen because it was not the same type of estrogen as in our body‚Äôs. (If i remember correctly it was something along those lines). I said i was scared to eat soy foods because it increases estrogen. Which i now according to research know isn‚Äôt true but it does act on the estrogen receptors which makes sense to my current understanding of Neuropharmacology.

"Asking for advice, I want to go semi-vegetarian. And I want to know if my plan sounds good for a beginner or not?","So. I apologize to you all for wanting to go semi-vegetarian and not full on vegetarian yet. But I would like to ease into things. 

My main motivators are these. 
1. My wife's getting bariatric surgery. So since her diet is going to be COMPLETELY changed once that happens. I want to make a big change too. 
2. Health. I want to eat healthy. I've realized over the past few weeks that I would really like to have a more ""natural"" diet. And become a healthier human being.
3. Weight loss. I would love to lose a few pounds. I'm not looking for any miracle diet. But just to be healthier and shave off a few pounds. 

So I would like to adopt a diet thats about 80% vegetarian. But I would still like to eat fish maybe once a week, twice a week tops. I may throw chicken in once in a while instead of fish. My idea is to eat vegetarian during the work week (I work 6 days a week usually) then on my off day is when I'll add in fish with dinner.

Abrahamic Justification,"Saluton. This isn't meant to start any fights or anything, but I'm curious if any of you guys are devoutly religious (specifically Islamic, Jewish, or Christian).

I'm only beginning on reading the Bible and studying religious texts, and I've only been vegetarian for three months now. I consider it a mental awareness, though, and I can't imagine eating an animal again (planning to go mainly plant-based even).

Meat cravings &amp; flexitarianism,"Firstly, I don‚Äôt mean to trigger or offend anyone with this post, I just need some advice and/or guidance and/or support. 

Being a ‚Äúflexitarian‚Äù or semi-vegetarian is a contested subject, but I believe it to be a good starting ground to eventually becoming a fully fledged vegetarian - giving up meat products cold turkey (lol at that saying in this context) is not easy for everyone. 

Initially I was a flexitarian only eating a meat product once maybe twice a month, but otherwise eating fully vegetarian for the rest of the time. This was for maybe roughly 6 months before I became fully vegetarian for the past 6 months. 

_The problem comes in now_: after the last 6 months of being fully vegetarian I am having __insane__ meat cravings. I‚Äôm struggling to resist the idea of going back to being a flexitarian. I‚Äôm struggling with the discipline of not consuming a meat product at the moment. The cravings are there, the thoughts are there, the temptation to give in is there. Sometimes I just want that burger or pizza. This is a month long thing and isn‚Äôt going away :/

Help! What do I do? Temporarily return to being a flexitarian? Satisfy the craving and return to normal? Has anyone else experienced this and if so how did you handle it? Waiting it out doesn‚Äôt seem to be working. 

I‚Äôm swaying towards the thought/idea that I should maybe give the flexitarian thing a chance again and then eventually move back to vegetarianism again - thoughts on this?

_Side note_: I chose a vegetarian lifestyle for environmental reasons, as well as for my beliefs and love for animals (I‚Äôm not sure what the right way to phrase it is). The guilt is there, this is conflicting :/

At first I thought it was a mistake but when I checked the order I confirmed it was my fault. I didn't want to waste a whole pizza, so we each had a slice. We also had several slices of their delicious cheesy bread, but that's neither here nor there.

Suffice it to say, I don't miss the meat one bit. If nothing else, it strengthened my resolve and reaffirmed my continued veggie lifestyle.

In closing-don't make the same mistake I did.",vegetarian,iahebert,1578499855,2,True,2020-01-08

Quorn Roasted Fillets Replacement (Fitness and UK Post),"Hi all,

New here despite being veggie for a number of years now.

For a while now I‚Äôve been keeping strict track of my calories and macros, training six times a week. It‚Äôs gone from my hobby to a way of life, which I suppose is good.

For lunch at work I‚Äôve been having Quorn Roasted Fillets with basmati rice, amongst other things. The Quorn fillets give me:

- 196 cals
- 10g fat
- 2.6g carbs
- 19.2g protein

My issue has come about because they cost ¬£2.50 per pack, which equates to ¬£12.50 a week on them alone; something I really need to cut down on.

Is there anything anyone knows of that is similar in macros but far cheaper?

Apologies for the long post but TLDR:

Need a cheaper replacement with similar macros for Quorn Roasted Fillets here in the UK.

"What are some good, filling recipes that are not carb-based?","Hello! I've been vegetarian for about 3 years now, since meeting my husband who is culturally vegetarian (Jain). We split the cooking pretty evenly, and he has no shortage of delicious, vegetable-based curries to cook. However, everything I make tends to be pastas, rice dishes, etc, where the carb is the primary part of the meal and would not really make sense to eat with a side dish.

Back when I ate meat, I would make a meat as the main (usually salmon or chicken/turkey) with a carb and veggie as a side, and I was very healthy. However, I feel like everything I cook now ends up being pretty high in calories, and my husband and I have both gained a ton of weight over the last couple years. I love cooking and am quite good at it, I just want a bit more of a healthy variety. Right now the closest thing I make that fits the bill is enchiladas, which I love but I definitely need some additional options.

Important to note:
* I have a dairy intolerance, so I already cook everything with cashew or coconut milk and nutritional yeast is a staple

* I already add as many vegetables as I can to my pastas and rices (as well as fake meats). I'll pretty often make use of zoodles as well

* My husband hates anything ""leafy"" - no broccoli, nothing green and crunchy, and definitely no salads if they involve any kind of lettuce.

Animals are killed in the egg and dairy industries too. You have the killing of calves, and dairy cows once they're too old, as well as male chicks, which in the egg industry are considered byproducts.

2. Other plants like mushroom, ginger, onions, carrots, tomatoes, etc, would make (**30%**) of my main meal diet;
3. I also trim down carb with high Glycemic index in my main meal diet like rice and noodles, I will make these starch-based food (10%) in my main meal diet;
4. I love eating seafood and eggs (4-5 per day) so they would be (15%) in my main meal diet;
5. My family eats meat, but they believe similar theory I believe -- eat far more plants than meat, therefore the (5%) will be terrestrial animal meat in my main meal diet;
6. I don't like eating beans or Tofu, I know it's weird since I am Asian. I also dislike them and nuts because they are a hassle to deal with, they need to be processed to remove all the enzymes, oxalic acid, phytic acids or tannins. So they cannot be a part of my main meal diet.

One-week Vegetarian Challenge Help!,"Hey everyone!

Just looking for some help and I figured this would be a good place to start. Earlier this year, I was living in student accommodation and a lot of the meals I prepared were vegetarian. It was partly due to how much it was cheaper to go vegetarian, while also living with a bunch of other vegetarians/vegans. When I moved back home, this kind of stopped because no one else in my family is vegetarian. However, I recently watched 'The Game Changers' on Netflix and would love to pick up on easing back into a vegetarian diet. I've also convinced my family to try it for a week! 

The problem is that my meals lacked variety, namely due to student budget and also not having the best kitchen appliances for more adventurous meals. So, I would eat the same thing for weeks on end. It wasn't a problem for me, but I feel like if I want to my family to enjoy the beauties of going vegetarian, I should have at least some variety to offer. I was wondering if you guys have any recommendations on what meals/recipes I could easily prepare?

Our breakfasts are already vegetarian. We do oatmeal with fresh fruits, and peanut butter on toast. So, I'm possibly looking for some meals that are suitable for lunch and dinner. Bonus points if there are overlapping ingredients as well and easy on the budget!

My sibling is newly veggie/vegan and I want to support him but also address his mental health. They're intertwined. Help?,"I love my brother so much. I think it is great that he is a new vegan. But this has come about at a time when he is really struggling with his mental health and a breakup, and I am trying to figure out how to support his dietary choices while advocating that he get help for his current mental health needs. 

If anyone went through a similar thing on your journey  your comments would be appreciated. 

1. He is struggling with self harm. I saw clear evidence of this the other night. From what he has said to our parents it is partly due to a recent rough breakup but also due to guilt for having eaten meat and sadness for the animals still dying. This is an EXTREMELY concerning factor and my family just seems to think he is worried about the animals rather than taking the self harm seriously.   
2. Similar vein, the other day (we were visiting family) he was sobbing to a family member about the suffering of the animals. I support the vegetarianism for the ethical reasons... but I think my family has blinders on about how significantly abnormal this reaction is? Did you all encounter similar feelings? Did you cry about these animals when you first stopped eating them?   
3. From a self care perspective, he is now vegan but is not eating in such a way that he can forgo vitamins and is not taking them at all. He doesn't seem to think this is a big problem. My family thinks he will figure it out. I think it can not be good for his already-poor mental health.   

4. I'm vegetarian a few days each week. I'm working to reduce overall animal consumption and to get what I do eat locally/sustainably. My point is, I'm not an idiot nor am I unsympathetic. This is not good enough for him. He insists that he is morally superior (and on telling me so) because my life habits kill animals. I can concede that. But in the same conversation where I'm applauding his choices, he tells me that: me saying I don't mind supporting my local farmers and buying their meat is the same as people supporting slavery in the south for the sake of the farmers, tells me that my drinking milk is evil and showing me videos of abused cows, and calling me a ""typical omni"" (those words) when I expressed that I felt sustainable meat eating was an okay goal as we are naturally omnivores (which you might disagree on, and that's fine!).
My problem is, I tried to stop the conversation several times and he would bring things back up or engage again. 

And look, I'm aware that he is not in a great mental state right now so I don't care if he wants to attack me and my life choices a little. I can take that. I am worried because the way he is going about these points... arguing, accusing, and insulting-- has already started to alienate other friends and family. Even folks that are vegetarians don't like how he is treating others about it.


My family is indulging him and I feel like I'm the only one who is MOSTLY just worried about his mental health. But it is so intertwined with his newfound vegan lifestyle that any voiced concerns about his current state are drowned out by ""He is just worried about the animals.""

"The runup to christmas has me very nervous, advice?","I recently made the switch after a **very bad** experience with a raw chicken breast.

Alternatives to soy-based products,"My husband and I just decided this week to try and make the switch to a plant-based/vegetarian diet due to health concerns (him being diagnosed as pre-diabetic, and I having been through a bout of cancer almost five years ago), and a general ‚Äúgreen‚Äù mentality.

Increasing sensitivity to dairy?,"    I‚Äôve been a vegetarian for about two and a half years. Dairy is a pretty normal part of my diet, including eggs as well. I‚Äôve never been a big milk drinker, so large amounts of dairy has always kind of irritated my stomach. Recently, i‚Äôve made the switch to strictly Oatmilk in place of just about everything that normal milk would be used. 
   
   Since then, i‚Äôve noticed that cheese (which, unless in large amounts, never used to hurt my stomach) has started to make my stomach pretty upset. I figured that was normal since I have recently cut out milk almost entirely. 

  However, i was quite surprised when, after eating an egg last night, things went pretty south pretty fast (literally). 

   I‚Äôve never experienced stomach pain quite like this before, my stomach is very upset and it hasn‚Äôt stopped being upset since I ate ONE EGG last night , this may be TMI but nothing is passing, however, my stomach is in knots. 

   Is this purely because of my vegetarian diet?? Does this happen to all vegetarians over time?? Should I just go vegan at this point?? Has this happened to any of you? Please help me, I love cheese.

University Christmas meat-based lunch: to go or not to go?,"I've been vegetarian for over a year. I've had my slipups, but because I didn't properly check the ingredients list/done my research, not because of cravings. In fact, I don't miss meat/fish at all. I've never been a huge fan of these foods, so it's been fairly easy so far.

However, in my university, there's a tradition: the oldest students prepare a Christmas lunch for the new ones (including me), to spend time together and get to know each other (our course is very small, less than 20 people per year). It's a great idea and I'd love to participate. The problem is that they'll be cooking traditional meals of my area, which revolve around meat. There isn't a single dish that's meatless. I'm the only vegetarian in the class and I'm not in the position to ask for a special menu. Furthermore, everyone in my class will be there, and I don't want to miss out on something.

What I'm asking is: is it wrong if I eat those heavily meat-based dishes? Especially if I don't really like the taste either? I always preach flexibility, that what matters is what you do 90% of the time, not on occasion, but it feels wrong to eat meat, considering that I absolutely don't need it for health reasons, nor I like it. At the same time it feels wrong to be the only one who doesn't participate. And no, going there without eating isn't an option.. Finally, could I get sick? Considering that I haven't eaten those foods in over a year, is there any chance I'd have trouble digesting them?

I tried Beyond Meat Burger,"Dunno if this fits here. I saw thesw Beyond Meat Burgers in my super market so I decided to try them out. 

First thing I noticed was that they fall apart a lot easier than normal meat. Wasnt very much of a detriment just had to handle them more carefully.

I had to salt them quite a lot. The first one I didnt salt all that much an thus had almost no taste. Something that I did not notice but my mother did was the smell while grilling them. My mother is a criminal investigator and according to her it smelled just like a burn victim. 

The taste was good. I did a direct comparison to real meat with a patty I made myself and I did notice a few differences. They were not worse or better just slightly different. I could probably notice now that I know how it tastes, I likely wouldnt have noticed before.

The texture, arguably the most important part about meat was really good. It wasnt quite as bitey as real meat, which is not necessarily bad. The burger was also juicier than real meat which was better.

I also tested it on my (very picky) older sister who I did not tell it was fake meat. She did not notice a difference and said it tasted good. On telling her it was vegetarian she eyed it suspiciously but ate the rest.

All in all I can definitely recommend it as a fake meat. I personally will probably not buy all that many. Simply because I can make burgers of the same taste for 1/4 of the money and my moral compass isnt strong enough to be vegetarian.",vegetarian,Mad_Maddin,1575744130,4,True,2019-12-07

"Ate meat while sleepwalking, idk how to feel about this..","So, I live with some roommates who made soup in a crockpot overnight that had meat, they said I‚Äôm welcome to it but knew I didn‚Äôt eat meat but still offered to be considerate and I politely declined, however I got really stoned and pretty buzzed and when I fell asleep sometimes get problems sleepwalking, peeing in weird places very often, more often I‚Äôm just really stoned and get up with munchies and apparently stuff my face, it sucks bc I‚Äôm not even conscious to enjoy it lmao.

Managing low blood pressure on a vegetarian diet?,"It's awesome that vegetarianism/veganism helps people lower their high blood pressure, but what about those of us who need to raise it?

I have been reducing my animal product consumption consistently over the last few years, and pondering going completely vegetarian or even vegan. But I've been noticing that my blood pressure has gotten lower seemingly in direct correlation with how little meat I eat. For most people that might be good, but I already had healthy BP (always around 120/70). My last BP measurement was 106/52. Twice, I had trouble donating blood which was never a problem before. (Both feeling ill and not having the blood pressure to safely donate.) I sometimes feel faint after meals or when I try to stand up. I am not anemic and do not have a thyroid issue.

I eat TONS of salt and always have. I do not avoid fats. I take protein powder, eat plenty of legumes, and sprinkle nutritional yeast on everything. I drink 1-2 cups of coffee per day. I drink in moderation. I eat way too much sugar and flour, which probably doesn't help me.

I know there are ways to manage this using plant foods, but I'm clueless on how to start. Apologies if this is the wrong place to post! Please let me know where else to ask this question. :)",vegetarian,tiredanonperson,1575859203,11,True,2019-12-08

Non-lab grown/fake meat vegetarian alternatives to meat purely in terms of texture?,"Hi,

Since a bad accident last year I have completely lost my sense of taste except for those on my tongue (spiciness, sourness, sweetness, etc.) . To cope with this I mainly eat based on texture, such as things with a nice crispy crunch or meat with a nice fibre-like texture with juices flowing. Now since I can't taste the actual meat anymore I feel like it's a waste to continue eating meat, mainly in terms of cost, environment and the animals. 

Unfortunately, lab-grown meat is more expensive than regular meat here (Netherlands) and often comes in ready-made meals which I don't like either, so I'm looking for other alternatives. Thanks",vegetarian,feladirr,1575907974,10,True,2019-12-09

Going Vegetarian (Or Vegan?),"Hi so I have a problem. I have pretty severe health issues that largely manifest as dietary restrictions and G.I. issues.

This is a problem of course because I know how abusive and horrible our meat industry is/can be.

I guess I'm looking for advice or encouragement... maybe an answer to my concerns re: bee population, free range, and so on, but I just don't know what to do. 

I don't want to contribute to an abusive industry, but I love sushi. Its probably my only real birthday wish every year. I love eggs and milk is probably my favorite non-soda drink (I'm trying so hard to kick the soda habit and milk helps). I have always understood that beekeeping helps the bee population regain its foothold after being on the decline. I don't know what to do.",vegetarian,whilowhisp,1575999988,8,True,2019-12-10

only human

Death is on my shoulder

it makes it hard 

simply being alive

if we‚Äôre just supposed to survive

and what‚Äôs even more fucked up

is it‚Äôs only for me to thrive

with all these other guys

subjected to only fight for their lives

and even when i know all these things

and I know of their fight

I still just discard them and kill them

in a designated fucking building

telling me it‚Äôs just what I gotta do to survive

and it‚Äôs just part of human life

I even fear death

but never stops and wonders why

i took it upon myself 

to carry out his sentence

But I just wipe the blood of my hands

after all i'm only human

and to err is my fate

but when were the only sentience

who can dictate

they whyy  
when even amongst ourselves

we declare war on dictators and their tyranny

are we not seeing the hypocrisy

and the tyrants we‚Äôve been  


and when death is a business

it becomes my business

to declare my testimonial witness

to this sickness

and how we‚Äôre all stricken

but we cannot  see it ourselves

"I want to have a more Plant Based Diet, but I have some limitations...any suggestions?","Hi Everyone! New here, and looking for some guidance.  It has been a desire of mine to transition to a more plant based diet with ovo-lacto vegetarian being my main diet, but I keep running into some road blocks, so it never gets off the ground. 

Over the last 2 years, I have made great strides in upping my veggie and whole food intake, with a lot more fresh foods and a lot less processed foods.  I don't eat nearly as much red meat (2-3 times a year), and the bulk of my protein comes from lean fish or poultry where I know the source.  So, I have slowly been cutting down my animal protein consumption but have hit a road block. 

I have endometriosis, and as it happens Gluten causes it to flare up pretty terribly putting me into terrible pain, so I have had to cut that entirely from my diet, I also have to limit soy intake for similar reasons (so I save it for sushi and miso soup).  Because a lot of ""meat replacement"" products are heavy on gluten and soy (I live in a rural so my options are limited), I can't eat many of them, and struggle with how processed some are.  I am also not a huge fan of many beans (but I keep trying!).  So my concern is how do I do this, when the diet is already limited. 

So I am looking for a place to start, resources, things like that. I need healthy protein in my diet or I struggle with my health and focus.  I am adventurous with trying new recipes and new foods.  There are very few veggies and fruits I turn my nose up at, so I have some up for the work, but I am stuck on where to start!

Question for new vegetarians/wfpb,"Does it ever feel like you're learning how to cook all over again?

As an omnivore, my husband loves my cooking. We mastered the perfect steak, roasted chicken, bbq, chilis, stews, curries, and tons of ethnic dishes with animal based protein as the star of the plate.

Recently I've been wanted to transition to vegetatian due to the environmental impact and having learned all of the implications that animal protein has on our bodies, I'm pretty grossed out by most meat now. 

My husband is supportive and sometimes will eat my veggie based meals or I'll cook him a ""side"" of meat when it comes to dinner time. 

Its worked well but I've flopped a couple times(lentil sloppy joes and tempeh bacon were huge L's). I've always been secure with my abilities as a home cook but learning my way around new plant proteins have been challenging and I get discouraged. 

I'm also not a huge fan of processed meat substitutes(besides veggie burgers), so throwing a pile of chik'n strips in with whatever I'm cooking doesnt make it more appealing nor do I find it as nutritious as whole foods.

I want to continue my veggie journey. Cooking is one of my biggest passions, its also one of my creative outlets and how I distress after a long day of work.

All those articles are claiming persons with O blood type actually need animal protein due to a specific enzyme produced by ingestion of meat. This enzyme supposedly has the benefit of assisting the digestion of animal based protein and animal fat (which seems to be contradictory on its own with a meat free diet). And on top of that, due to meat restriction, this could lead to diabetes and cardiovascular conditions.

Any of you know anything about it? Is this a ""real thing"" and if so, should I consider some supplements?",vegetarian,DrFrankenDerpen,1576089374,13,True,2019-12-11

"WWJD? I‚Äôm not religious but I have a small rant that can be related to this odd saying. Odd as it‚Äôs rarely used to really think how Jesus acted. Compassion to everyone. I make this rant here towards Vegans, but can apply to everyone.","I‚Äôve been wanting to go vegetarian and mostly vegan for basically my whole life. I often blamed my parents for not being able to the first half of my life. Then it was income and the fact I do love meat, smoked, dried, rare, sushi, eggs, seafood etc. I am a very upset person in the way humans act and treat the planet, animals and each other and have been since a very young age, but I have also been good at putting myself in others shoes and learned you can‚Äôt make people see and act as you see fit, that‚Äôs being a nazi as people so often like to call each other these days. But I‚Äôve come to realize that what holds me back are a few things. 

First, let‚Äôs talk about misinformation and how prevalent it is, most everyone in the agriculture field has a lot to gain in the consumption of animal products. It drives most of the industry even those growing plants as it mostly goes to feed the animals. Not to mention farming is industrialized mostly and owned by the same few corporations as the meat producers and consumer industries that distribute them all. So they put out ‚Äúinformation‚Äù that benefits them. 

Second, stop trying to convince people to go vegan with imitation meats! No it isn‚Äôt that they know it‚Äôs not meat is the only reason they can tell the difference, that‚Äôs just ridiculous. I‚Äôve tried several vegan meats and they never compare, maybe some are similar, but never that close unless it‚Äôs a greatly processed and seasoned/flavored product like hotdogs or some sausages but no hamburger has ever came close. Now that‚Äôs not to say they cannot be good.

Third, stop attacking and name calling. I am not posting nor ever again visiting the Vegan Reddit. Why? Because most I read was aggressive and hateful posts about anyone who doesn‚Äôt agree with them, dare I say, like a Nazi! Nothing gets people to go against you like calling them names like ‚Äúomniscum‚Äù! Seriously is it working for Trump?!

So I say the things holding me back have been lack of friendly non judgmental people helping me find foods and recipes I love and enjoy so I can lessen my dependency on meat, not replace it, but not miss it being gone. People who share in a friendly way the things they love without being political or righteous about it. I am trying to improve myself and the impact I have to the world, not just in the food but all aspects of my life, and it isn‚Äôt easy for so many reasons. But being judgmental and proud doesn‚Äôt work well with me!
Try being compassionate and understanding not everyone agrees with Hitler... um you and forcing them to do so is exactly the opposite of freedom. Try compassion and sharing your recipes anyplace they fit not just as a ‚Äúvegetarian/vegan‚Äù dish but just as a tasty dish, I strongly believe more people will try a delicious recipe before a artificial food that veggie burgers and the lot come off as. Why can‚Äôt it just be a delicious sandwich that happens to not contain meat?! Everyone already does this all the time anyway with many foods because they are not advertised as Vegan/vegetarian. I‚Äôm not perfect or a writer so forgive me, I just want to see people trying to be more compassionate and less ‚Äúright‚Äù!

R/shakshouka is a subreddit for all recipes that mainly consist of eggs and tomatoes. Many cuisines all over the world have dishes that are similar to shakshuka. Like eggs in purgatory, Sicilian uova in purgatorio, Chinese stir-fried tomato and scrambled eggs, Mexican huevos rancheros, Indian egg curry, and Turkish menemen.

Aside from the traditional recipes, you‚Äôre very welcome to make up your own and share it.

For instance: one person served it with grits, which I‚Äôm sure tasted great. Another combined it with basmati rice. Someone else paired it with Indian naan bread. Get creative and share your own twist on eggs with tomatoes!

One thing is for sure, eggs+tomatoes+cheese/beans makes for a nutritious vegetarian meal, with lots of protein. And it‚Äôs so cheap and easy to prepare. I could eat eggs and tomatoes every day and never get bored of it.

Or does it become quick mushy like red lentils? Hope this makes sense LOL thanks,vegetarian,rawshrimp,1576441199,11,True,2019-12-15

"I cheated... To any other new vegetarians out there, I don't recommend it!","So I work at a cafe/bakery and have been a vegetarian for about two months now. We occasionally cater for certain events. Yesterday, we were making cranberry chicken meat balls. *They smelled incredible.* I've been a bit of a foodie for quite sometime and chicken meatballs *with cranberries* is something I've never tried before. All my coworkers were ranting and raving about how good they were, and I really felt like I was missing out on something spectacular. I took the smallest meatball and popped it into my mouth just to ""sample it.""

 Honestly? I've made better tasting vegetarian meals at home than that. I felt sick to my stomach with guilt as soon as I swallowed this ball of ground up meat.

Moral reasons to not eat meat you didn't buy?,"I've been vegetarian for just about two months now. I'm not super hardcore or self-righteous about it; really one day I was just like ""nah, killing animals unnecessarily isn't cool"" and that was the end of it. I made some adjustments to my diet and it hasn't been entirely too challenging. However, I work in a cafe, and we routinely throw out expired sandwiches, many of which contain meat. These are freely available for employees to take. Since I'm a broke-ass mf, 3-5 meals a week being taken care of for me would help a lot. And since they would literally be going in the trash otherwise, I don't see how me consuming these sandwiches would contribute to the exploitation of animals. Like today I had a turkey bacon egg and cheese sandwich and just threw the turkey out and was like...this doesn't make sense to me from a pragmatic standpoint.  

As I've said, I'm not super hardcore about my vegetarianism and I don't base my identity around it or anything, but I do try to live by my principles and not contribute to the exploitation of animals.

Transitioning to Vegetarian with cheat days,"First time posting on this subreddit! I‚Äôve been lurking for some time now, and the community is what finally convinced me to go Vegetarian.

So I finally decided to become Vegetarian 2 months ago but I‚Äôm finding it hard to go full Vegetarian. I decided to go cold turkey, which might not be a good idea. 

My boyfriend still eats meat but is really considerate and supportive of my choice, so are my friends. Whenever we order food, they would order a Vegetarian option for me. See, the problem is, whenever I‚Äôm eating alone I don‚Äôt crave meat at all, but when I‚Äôm eating with my friends and see them eating meat, I suddenly have the urge to try their food. I think it might be related to psychology more, how we crave the things we don‚Äôt have (Although I‚Äôm not sure).  So when I see my friends eating meat, I crave in and eat some
of their and would feel guilty afterwards, because whenever I do, I would go back to eating meat for a while then completely stoping again once I felt enough guilt. I realize this might not be a healthy approach to food so I decided to try something new. I gave myself ‚Äúcheat days‚Äù once a week. 

I would go a week without eating meat then on Sunday I would treat myself to one meat-based main course, whether it be for lunch or dinner. So if I ate meat for lunch, I wont eat it for dinner or vice versa. Then I‚Äôll slowly to once every two weeks, then once a month, and so on and so fort. 

I wanted to know if anyone else had tried this way in order to slowly transition to Vegetarianism? Are cheat days even allowed? Can I even still call myself Vegetarian if I eat meat once in a while?",vegetarian,anunimportantaccount,1572762285,10,True,2019-11-03

I'm thinking about doing the same thing for eggs and dairy--that is, not eliminating something as an option just because it says or might have 'skim milk' as the 9th ingredient on the list.

I do a lot of physical activity and I'm finding it harder to stay as lean as I like as I get older. This has brought me around to the idea of being vegetarian.

I also believe you can get that from a plant based diet but information about how to go about doing that is very slim. Even in the FAQ in this sub theres a list of proteins, but no breakdown of the combinations required to build complete profiles. For somebody like myself that controls nutrition down to the micronutrient this is absolutely maddening. I don't mind doing my own leg work on building the flavors around it, but I need to know my constraints. I'm sick of reading 'dont worry, you'll get complete proteins'.

I have a huge problem with Hunting animals as a Hobby.,"This is probably going to be controversial- I'm just going to clarify that hunting does not make someone a bad person, but I think hunting is a bad thing. I also want to clarify that I am in a first-world country, in an area where majority of poverty is in the city. 

Meat-eating culture is a huge aspect where I live- in fact, so cultural that the meat farmers come on the radio about once a month to shit talk the Plant-based burgers at the local A&amp;W. The area I'm in is extremely rural, with lots of meat farms, vegetable farms, crops and forest. Hunting is extremely common in this area, and I'm starting to have a problem with it. I'm fine with omnivorous people (my family and friends are omnivorous) and I feel like it isn't in my place to comment on someone's diet negatively, however I have a huge problem with hunting for leisure. 

I believe that hunting is only in good taste if you need it. You're in a life or death situation, where you either have to eat or be eaten- and there are no other food sources nearby- but this is a situation many people are not in. Why on earth does someone need to hunt when the grocery store is nearby, with meat already in it?  You're paying for ammunition, firearms, camo clothes, licenses, traps, snares- it's going to take a lot of killing for you to save money on meat. You're killing an animal that you don't need, only for the game of killing something. And of course you post the body on instagram, tie it on your truck and drive through town to run errands with it strapped to your vehicle. Don't get me wrong, I hate factory farming, but there's already dead animals at the store. You physically do not have to go out and shoot something when there's meat you can already eat and already do eat. Sure, the animals you're eating that you hunted had a better life, but you still ended it when you did not have to. 

The methods of hunting aren't even humane. Hunters set up traps around the countryside that suffocate animals for fur and meat, and last year I lost my one-year-old golden retriever to a trap hidden near my property. What is the point of killing something for fun- people in my area have become so pent up with the joy of killing something that they run over coyotes for amusement, choke them, kill them and post it on the internet as well. 

Sorry about the controversy- I am very against hunting and what it's doing in my area. I feel like losing my dog Jasper was my turning point. Does anyone agree or disagree? Whatever your opinion is please let me know. I'd like to know if maybe I'm going a little too extreme on the hunters. Thank you.",vegetarian,polipodo,1572976585,6,True,2019-11-05

How do you actually respond to people who‚Äôs livelihood veg/vegan diets are actually hurting?,"I‚Äôm posting this here instead of the vegan subreddit, because I like this community better (no hate, just preference), but I am vegan. Have been for a long time. 

I recently moved back pretty close to my hometown. Where I grew up, you either become a farmer/teacher, or leave. There‚Äôs a grocery store, a school, and 30+ farms. Most of them are dairy/beef farms. 

Now of course you and I know the importance of living meat/animal product free. But a lot of these people are my lifelong friends. I‚Äôm not the type to cut someone out because they‚Äôre still living the omni lifestyle. They aren‚Äôt demons, and I grew up around their farms. They‚Äôre small/family owned and nothing like the ones you see on shock docs. I‚Äôm not saying this makes it right, or that I agree with it, but I‚Äôm just saying. 

These people are hurting. Heading for bankruptcy.

Hello and question about Thanksgiving,"Hello all. So my doctor has me switched to a whole plant based diet because of my weight (occasionally can have meat). No big deal to me because I don't particularly care for any meats other than chicken fried steak. Only eat it once a year though.

Anyway, Thanksgiving is coming up and I've been eating mostly vegan for the last couple weeks. I haven't had any dairy whatsoever and have had meats for about 3 meals this entire time. Not going to lie meat is starting to taste like shit.

I was trying to think of some foods that are naturally on the menu for thanksgiving that are at least vegetarian. I'm drawing blanks though. 

What foods can I ask my family to make that won't make me seem like a total pain in the ass? I'll be bringing my own tofurky ham so that part won't be a huge deal, just pop it in the oven.

Holiday deserts?,"Good evening, ladies and gents.

I've a birthday coming up, and wanted to invite a few people in, when I've learned that one of my friends turned (lacto-)vegetarian. On its own, it's not a problem to come up with good dishes - the best things I cook are already vegetarian/vegan, but what made me think harder were deserts, which often have eggs and gelatin in them - which she wouldn't want to eat. I love baking, but I've never made anything vegan before, and am a bit lost. Of course, I could've made separate meals for her, but I wouldn't want to separate the group like tha.

The first suggestion I had was vegetarian carrot cake, but the thing is, my birthday is very early January, so we'll be celebrating it, Christmas, and New Year's Eve at this one day, so I'd really love to make something more flamboyant, so to speak, to sort of support this holiday mood, and cookies and carrot cakes are usually quite ""ordinary"" so to speak. You wouldn't expect them on a triple occasion when you're a guest.

"Recipe: One of my top chocolate-chip cookie recipes (gluten-free as well, and actually GOOD!)","# [Photo](https://i.imgur.com/Su8uh5H.jpg) 

## What's awesome about this recipe:

The picture is a bit deceiving - these are amazingly good chocolate-chip cookies. ¬†Like, *awesomely* good. ¬†No dairy.  No flour. ¬†No eggs. ¬†No refined sugar.  They're *almost* vegan, aside from the honey (I haven't tried any vegan honeys with this recipe yet, like Bee Free Honee, but I'd imagine it'd work fine...might have to try date syrup down the road too!).

They kind of bake up in the shape of a ball, because they don't really spread out.  They are best enjoyed warm (or warmed up a bit), like with a 10 or 20-minute cooling period out of the oven to let the chocolate re-solidify a bit.  

## Ingredients:

* 2 cups Almond Meal (regular, not fine)
* 1/4 teaspoon Sea Salt (plus a bit extra for topping)
* 1/3 teaspoon Baking Soda
* 1/4 cup Coconut Oil (melted)
* 1 Tablespoon Honey
* 1 Tablespoon Maple Syrup
* 2 teaspoons Vanilla ([imitation is fine](https://sweets.seriouseats.com/2013/12/taste-test-is-better-vanilla-extract-worth-the-price.html))
* 1/3 cup Dark Chocolate Chips (I like Enjoy Life's [mini semi-sweet](https://enjoylifefoods.com/products/semi-sweet-chocolate-mini-chips-1?variant=20209502879855) chocolate chips)
* 1/3 cup Walnuts

## Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 350F
2. Mix almond meal, salt, baking soda by hand (I use a [Danish dough whisk](https://www.amazon.com/Original-Danish-Dough-Whisk-alternatives/dp/B00HQQJ3N6))
3. Add coconut oil (melt in microwave bowl or stovetop pot), honey, maple syrup, vanilla, and mix well
4. Stir chocolate chips &amp; walnuts (just crush the walnuts by hand to make them the size you want) into mixture
5. Roll into a ball (ice cream scooper helps; I usually make them about 1.5"" tall) - the mixture is usually crumbly &amp; needs to be pressed together by hand to stay in a ball - and place onto a parchment-lined baking sheet
6. Gently flatten with your palm as you put them on the cookie sheet (they don't spread out much)
7. Add a pinch of sea salt to the top

"My parents are staunchly against my choice to be vegetarian, can I get some support please?","The same arguments, the same discussion over and over again. My mom literally cried tonight when I said that chicken stock wasn't vegetarian. She asked me ""who are you trying to impress?"" and that REALLY hurt me.

Some common arguments from my parents in quotes, and my responses in parentheses:

""It's not natural, we evolved to be omnivores"" 

(Natural doesn't automatically make it better)

""Experts don't know everything, what if you need something in meat that they haven't found yet?""

(On one hand I have all of this evidence for why eating meat is not a good idea, and on the other hand I have this nebulous argument about things scientists may not have found yet. I'm liable to choose from the side I know more about)

""Why not just eat organic or ethically sourced meat?"" 

(Because I can't know for certain that that animal wasn't tortured, and besides, cutting an animal's life short just because I like the taste isn't ethical)

""It's not healthy/balanced to cut an entire food group from you diet""

(As long as you're supplementing with plant proteins and B12 then you're getting all the same stuff) 

""Soy is so bad for you. Your grandmother ate soy and she bled because of the estrogen"" (true story as far as I know)

(Soy is not bad for you, it's a food like any other)

""There are things in animal meat that you JUST CAN'T GET from plants"" 

(That's why I carefully monitor my protein intake, as well as take a B12 supplement) 

""Yeah but B12 supplements are scary/there was a study that found a link with cancer"" 

(As far as we know, B12 supplements are safe and effective) 

""It's worse for the environment to make fertilizer for fruits/vegetables than ANY amount of factory farming or cow farts""

(Even if that was true, which it isn't, why would I ADD to the amount of greenhouse gasses and overall suffering by choosing to eat meat? I could still lessen impact by choosing to not eat meat. I don't have a choice when it comes to fruits and veggies, you need to eat those) 

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see I can hold my own, but damn it's getting old. Also every time we have the discussion, I feel like I'm being gaslit, or that maybe vegetarianism isn't healthy. What really fucks me up is that my parents simultaneously say that you can't defer to the experts, but then they do it all the time, so when I go online after each discussion to make sure vegetarianism is healthy, I feel like I can't trust anyone, and that's a super dangerous mindset to fall into. So I guess I feel like I just need support. Was anyone else's parents/loved ones just completely against them being vegetarian? I feel like this is an insane reaction, and normally my parents are very level-headed people.

Meat is bad for you. Its bad for the environment. Its expensive. Its difficult to cook. Some people even have moral issues with it 

Ask them if they have any good reasons other than ""that's how I was raised "" or ""I like the taste "" 

Then make sure to tell them they need to evolve. Their parents didn't have smartphones or the internet either. If they can learn to use those things they can learn to change their diet 

 And that veggies taste just as good as meat if you know how to cook. Taste is no excuse 

Does anyone NEED to explain their life of diet to you ? No! Heck no! But if they feel the need to be preachy and intrusive then they're hypocritical if they can't answer the same questions coming from you",vegetarian,davidducker,1573279227,17,True,2019-11-09
Is leather the lesser evil?,"I have been vegetarian since I was 13 and this has always included not buying fur or leather. However, I did have a pair of boots purchased for me before that time, and continued to wear them. I have been wearing them almost daily for 12 years now and they are in great condition, though I have to get the heels fixed every few years. 

I have been buying pleather/synthetic coats and shoes for 12 years as well, and I have to throw these products out each year as they fall apart- they are simply not as durable as leather.

My question is: am I actually harming more animals in buying the synthetic products than if I were to buy one leather item that lasts for years? I know the manufacture and disposal of plastics is really harmful to wildlife, especially in the ocean, while the hide used for leather comes from the meat industry. Just curious which option you think results in the least suffering overall.",vegetarian,insaneclownkosse,1573290897,29,True,2019-11-09

Just had the most disappointing experience at a restaurant...,"I‚Äôve been vegetarian for about 4 years now and have chosen a vegetarian lifestyle to reduce my climate footprint and for animal rights. 

Tonight I went out to a high end Spanish tapas restaurant for dinner with a friend. I went to this restaurant a couple of years ago and it was really good. But unfortunately tonight‚Äôs experience has tainted that memory.

It‚Äôs important to note that this restaurant markets itself as being vegetarian, vegan and gluten free friendly, while not exclusively being vegetarian. I ordered a tasting plate (a mix of the different tapas items) and requested that it be made vegetarian. The waiter confirmed that would be OK and so I ordered it. When it came out, everything looked vegetarian so I ate through it. I got to one dish that appeared to look like thing onion rings and took one bite and realised it was calamari! 

I let the waiter know that I had in fact ordered a vegetarian version of the tasting plate and he was so rude about it. No apology. No offer to replace my dish with something else. Just a ‚Äúso what‚Äù attitude. I was just so shocked at how dismissive he was! I understand that people make mistakes but this was unacceptable behaviour. I expect better, especially at a high end restaurant. 

We went and paid for the bill (the same rude waiter handled this). I then went downstairs and found another waitress and explained the incident. She was very apologetic and took down my name and email address. Let‚Äôs see if I hear back from that restaurant.

Meat eater interested in taking steps to change my diet,"TL;DR below
&amp;nbsp;

To give some background info on myself, I'm in my mid 30s, M, 6'1, underweight and somewhat fit. I don't work out but the type of work I do is physically demanding so I guess that would be some form of an exercise. Where I come from, meat is a part of our culture and I grew up eating a lot of it. I never thought twice about changing my diet unless it was to try and gain weight when I was younger, which I did attempt for the sake of trying to look 'normal'. Even when I would count my calories and ate a surplus consistently, it was too tiring to force myself to eat when I wasn't hungry and if I skipped a beat, my metabolism got the best of me, so I have since stopped caring about it. It also made me feel sluggish.

My diet for the last 5 years or so hasn't been anything interesting. I wake up and eat 5 scrambled eggs with a cup of coffee for breakfast, I used to eat fast food for lunch everyday but have since skipped lunch going on a year now and stuck to eating snacks, and for dinner it's basically whatever I can cook up. Other than being underweight and looking sick, I consider myself to be healthy (self diagnosed). I don't get sick, ever, but I don't know if that's a gene thing or what. Although I feel healthy, I know I don't eat healthy and I'm sure my insides are bad.
&amp;nbsp;

I recently saw a documentary on Netflix called ""The Game Changers"" which looked to be more athletically driven but, it touched on just about everything in terms of health benefits and not just on performance gains. The documentary was put together well and it sparked some interest for me. I was thinking about taking steps to going with a vegetarian diet first and maybe a vegan diet eventually. I wake up really early for work, so because of the little time it takes to make eggs and coffee, that's what I've been sticking with. I'd like to substitute the eggs but with my lack of imagination and cooking skills, I don't know a quick vegetarian substitute which is why I'm here. I'm sure there's a plethora of sites, threads, and videos out there talking about this very thing but for the sake of not getting overwhelmed, I decided to start this thread for my own sake to keep everything contained here.

Where else should I look for high protein-low calories ingredients,"Hey.   

I turned vegetarian last year and my physical appearance and health had got worse and worse. I'm struggling to stay vegetarian. I haven't touched meat since then but I struggle to get enough protein on a daily basis. I struggle a lot. And the food I'm eating ... Man 100% is not healthy.  

 So.   

Here it is.  

 I need 130g of proteins per day. 

An example of a day:   

Breakfast  

Quacker oats satchet + 180ml cashew milk + 25g cashew + 1 toast + 10g peanut butter (523kcal 21g protein 51g carbs 26g fat)   

Snack  

Proteins youghurt (126 20 0.4 0.4)  

Lunch  

2 toast + 50g mature cheddar + 30g tomatoes + 30g cucumber + Quorn smoky ham slices (465kcal 33 48 14) 

snack 

phd whey protein bar (248kcal 30g protein 19g carbs 6g fat)

dinner 

100g mashed potatoes + 3 veg sausages + 40g halloumi + 50g tomatoes + 50g cucumber (390kcal 27g protein 22g carbs 22g fats) 

Now, the protein youghurt, and the protein bar -&gt; that's not healthy. 100%. the quorn smoky ham slices ... same. that's not healthy. it is processed food. 

I don't enjoy the food either. 

My blood checks (which I do every six months) are getting worse, my body fat percentage went from 13% to 20%. body mass it's still ok, but growth and exercise responsiveness is awful. 

My diet seems to depend more and more on protein shakes, b12 supplements, magnesium suplements, zinc supplements. I am always tiered and hungry. Also, I am an endomorph which means I can't eat too much to get my proteins from lentils or broccoli. I need sources with low calories and high protein.

I post anti meat things on my social medias daily, so im fully aware of everything that goes on in these industries. Maybe its my derealization making me feel dissconnected from it, idk. The point is i keep craving it, and i dont know what to do. Im going vegan in january, like im barely handling vegetarianism, but i feel so wrong for eating eggs, like its mad. I feel grossed out watching people eat meat, and even just eating eggs for me triggers bad things. I went vegetarian purely because i found these industries disgusting, even the egg indistey, which is why im going vegan in january.

Why don't people care?,"So I've been reading books and watching documentaries surrounding the idea of not consuming animal products. Not only for personal health but as well as environmental reasons.

I don't really care about the animals. I'll be honest about that. I mean, whatever, they're cows, fuck'em. What I DO care about is the longevity of our planet and the state of our environmental destruction. Animal products seem to pretty much be at the heart of that. Largest greenhouse gas emitters are the oil and gas industry right? Or wait no it was transportation. NOPE! Not even close, it's the livestock/animal product/meat/dairy industry!

When I talk about this stuff to my friends and family they all either tell me being vegetarian isn't healthy because you don't get proper nutrition (which is completely false) or they shrug and say well that's not my problem or that they love meat too much to even consider stopping. When I try to explain what they are saying is not true, that meat and dairy are completely unnecessary to consume they either say ""it's too hard"" or ""I don't care I love meat too much.""

Seriously? You don't care about the alarming rate at which the Earth is being destroyed? You don't care about the world will be in a seriously bad state by the year 2040. Seriously seriously bad shape. Some people have literally said to me ""well, I'll be long dead before any of this affects me.""

Oh really? What about your children, or your grand children, which a lot of these people had. They will be hugely affected by this. Most of the time I get a shrug or ""I don't know what to tell you.""

People seem to almost take it like a personal attack that I would even consider they shouldn't eat meat or dairy. Have people truly been this brainwashed? It's completely baffling to me.

What can I do about this? Nothing? I try to raise awareness surrounding these issues but I pretty much get a resounding ""I don't care."" I'm actually at a state now that I don't think I could consume a steak just out of the pure morality of it.

"Just out of curiosity, how does one feel 'full' on a vegetarian (or pseudo-vegetarian) diet?

The issue that we keep running into is that meat dishes give us the feeling of being satiated after a meal.

Feeling hungry almost directly after eating a veggie meal despite eating substantial portion(s)?,"Just like the title says...

I've recently gone back to a primarily vegetarian diet after being a strict vegetarian and overall 'healthy' eater (no alcohol, no sugar, refined foods, etc) for years, until I 'fell off the wagon' slowly but surely after moving to the South and found myself eating whatever I could find on the run while trying to balance work and health. 

Anyway, I've been noticing that anytime I eat a primarily veggie meal (today it was veggie curry+basmati rice), I feel hungry like an hour after I ate.

- Not all animals should be treated the same. We are at the top of the hierarchy.

- Animals were domesticated to be food for humans.
- Factory farming plant products is also bad for the environment.
- The taste of meat is superior and should be enjoyed.
- I don‚Äôt care how my food is prepared because my attachment to those animals is in my plan to eat them.

"Anyone start life as veg, go omni, and return to veg?","Title pretty much says it but I‚Äôll share some context. 

I was raised vegetarian for religious reasons (Seventh Day Adventist) and given that my whole family was and we spent our time with those who shared our diet, it came easy although my dad was just doing it to please mom, haha! I ate that way until I was about 24. At 24, having moved to the Midwest to attend school, I got tired of being the odd man out, the constant pressure of trying to eat a balanced diet in what is basically veggie hell, and cooking two meals as my husband was from the Midwest and a meat and potatoes guy. 

So I became Omni and ate that way until I turned 30 a few weeks ago. My husband actually suggested going veg as a family as we moved to California (where I‚Äôm from) and it‚Äôs dead simple here with the abundance of fresh produce and the cultural norm. 

I will say I MISSED being veg. I always avoided the meat as best I could when I was Omni but I am really embracing cooking all over again. 

Has anyone had this start-stop-start experience? Physically i feel much better, groceries are cheaper, and I enjoy sharing the benefits with my husband. It makes me happy that we share this!

I'd like to become vegetarian, however I've noticed digestion issues with legumes.
I have occasionally eaten legumes all my life. I can eat them from time to time.

Most places have vegetarian options, sections of the menu that is vegetarian, or you can even request for a vegetarian dish. 

But take note that sometimes the oils and stocks used in street food or popular food places might not be vegetarian or free from animal products (i.e. lard, gelatin, beef or chicken stock etc.) and you always have to ask.

People who are more concerned with the purity of their food rather than the results of their choices.,"Why? It's more of an eating disorder than an ethical choice at that point.

This is obviously personal experience but almost every single vegan and fellow vegetarian I've met is extremely concerned about not putting animal products in their body even accidentally or in small insignificant amounts. Like that is what matters, rather than making decisions to not eat meals with animal products to reduce the demand and therefore the harm they cause. 

Especially something like making a big deal about how their food needs to be cooked on a grill/flattop that didn't have animal products on it previously. This one is straight up ridiculous. You eating food that came off a grill that cooked someone else's meal does not change how much suffering was caused by their choice in meal nor how much you prevent with your choice in meal. If you could taste it sure but it's rather unlikely you will taste anything from a properly scraped and heated flat top. A restaurant my friend works at has an entirely separate flat top for vegetarian only purposes and only because the kitchen is visible to the front. Thanks to all those people involved in making such a big deal out of literally nothing that this restaurant is burning gas just to run a separate flat top. Good job polluting the environment further to satisfy your eating disorder.

Processed Foods,"Hello everyone! I have been hem-hawing about posting about this for a while because lord knows we all deal with enough flack about our food choices, but it's been really, really bugging me. And, I'm coming from a place of concern, not one of finger-pointing so please, please be kind!

I used be a strict vegetarian and was happily consuming brands like Morningstar Farms for their patties and sausages, etc. One day, while reading articles about cleaner eating, I realized that so much of what I was eating was frozen products that are ultra-processed. I know that ""processed"" is a pretty broad term and that any food that isn't simply pulled out of the ground and placed on the shelf as-is is technically processed. 

But, the vegetarian foods just seem ... so, so fake and not in a good way. The ingredients lists are pretty unnerving. And I have to admit, the BeyondMeat products make me feel a little squeaky inside. Are these foods truly healthy? Healthy for us and the planet? I know we all don't have the time or the money to stand in our kitchens all weekend doing food prep for the week, but I'm failing to see how they are at all beneficial especially when it comes to packaging. 

Now, I'll still occasionally buy a tray of Amy's cheese enchiladas and mow down on that sucker like there's no tomorrow, but Amy's has been around for ages and it just seems like these newer companies are just jumping on the latest food trend and are approaching it from a money-making stand point, and not one of health for us or the environment. Are these really the foods we want representing the vegetarian movement (like we really have a choice in the matter, but hopefully you see what I'm getting at).

I'm going to try being Vegetarian for a few months.,"Afternoon all!

As the title states I'm going to try being vegetarian for a period of 6 months starting November 1st.  I'm doing it both as a challenge to myself as well as using this diet as a way of regulating/tracking what I am eating and how much.  I've done a little research and I think i'm still going to eat eggs/cheese so officially it's going to be a lacto-ovo-vegetarian.  I really don't know how I can go without cheese.

So with that being said i'm looking for things I need to watch out for.  By eliminating my red meats I think an iron supplement can't hurt, but past that I really can't think of anything else I need to worry about.  Also, if I was to eliminate eggs from the diet, would that technically eliminate baked goods like cakes and such that use eggs in the recipe?  That now seems like a dumb question once I typed it out, but i'm gonna leave it for the sake of science.

"Made the switch two weeks ago, been feeling light headed.","A few years ago, I was vegan for a little over a year.

"What are your favorite easy, single-serving vegetarian dinners?","My husband and I are both working towards strongly reducing our meat consumption and have begun eating vegetarian meals more and more often. However, there are some nights where he's craving a burger, but I still want to avoid meat. He's always been the primary cook in our relationship, and I've just begun cooking again for the first time since college as part of my journey to enjoying more plant-forward meals, so I'm still a little nervous in the kitchen. I've been trying to find some simple, beginner-friendly vegetarian meals that I can easily whip up on the nights where I need to cook something just for myself. 

So far the only one I've managed to add to my repertoire is a simple mushrooms-and-egg-noodles dish. I cook some sliced mushrooms in a little (or a lot) of butter, add some fresh herbs and salt and garlic, then some vegetable broth once everything's had a chance to cook up a bit. I add cooked egg noodles at the end and mix it all together so that the noodles absorb the nice herb-y sauce that forms in the pot. It only takes me about 20 minutes to pull it all together, it's very forgiving to my lack of skill and precision, and it's tasty enough that I don't feel like I'm sacrificing anything by choosing a vegetarian meal, even if my husband is eating a burger next to me.

I ll get right to the point. I eat meat all my life (i am 40 yo ) and i enjoy it a lot. Most days of the week i used to eat meat. Any kind of meat.

The operation I work on is grass fed only, with hay in the winter. 
All that being said, when condidering non arable lands/land that requires fertilizer yearly to be agriculturally viable, which is more ethical, from an environmental standpoint, growing bison or growing wheat/corn/soybeans etc?

Thinking about going back to eating meat,"In June of this year while I was in California, I stopped eating meat.

What can I substitute meat with to maintain a protein source in these meals?,"**Disclaimer: Everybody always suggests tofu or other soy. I can't have soy, so please don't suggest a soy-based product. This is why I haven't just gone out and bought mock-meats. Most of them are made with soy.**

My spouse is omnivorous and I'm trying to incorporate more vegetarian and/or vegan meals into our diet that still appeal to an omnivore's palate. He is fine with beans, lentils, legumes, etc. I haven't yet tried making anything with nutritional yeast because I think that would be too much too quick.

Meat interacts with different types of dishes in different ways, so it might be easier to go on a recipe-by-recipe basis.

Here are some typical omnivorous meals for us:

Layered enchiladas (lasagna style layered)

Pasta &amp; tomato sauce with veggies

Pesto pasta

Sandwiches (meat &amp; cheese)

Mac &amp; cheese (this is fine, but I need a more protein heavy side because I don't like cheese sauce)

Mock Olive Garden Pasta Fagioli (has ground beef, otherwise fine)

Baked ziti/pasta (spouse finds the dish less fulfilling without ground beef)

Breakfast scrambler (has sausage, looking for a non-meat option that still has spiciness)

Mock Chipotle burrito bowl

.

There's no seafood in there because we don't eat any. There's also no salads because my teeth are *very* crooked and it's hard to eat leafy vegetables (we can't afford extensive dental work). We do meal prepping to save time and money, so most of our meals are things that can be easily frozen for leftovers or lunch the next day.

I could just take out the meat from my portions, but I'm worried about the amount of nutrients and calories I'm getting. I'd like to kill 2 birds with one stone by turning my meals vegetarian and hopefully adding some more nutrients.

Do you tell someone that there is an unknown meat product in food they were eating?,"If you see someone who you know is vegetarian eating something with a meat product (gelatin, beef fat, chicken stock, etc.) in it, that they might not know about, do you tell them?

I think it's an obvious answer that you should tell them before someone is going to eat something because that allows them to make an educated decision for themselves. However that's not always an option. 

I never really know what to do in that situation because I have been on both sides:

I was out at dinner the other night with a friend, I had a flat tire so she got there before me. She decided to order french fries as a snack. She had already eaten over half the plate by the time I had gotten there and was really enjoying them. I told her that they were cooked in beef tallow because I thought she deserved to know, but she was low key pissed at me. She was really mad that I ruined food that she had already eaten and had to pay for. I get where she's coming from, I very distinctly remember the day I stopped eating Poptarts because I learned they had gelatin in them. I'm glad I know, but also I was really enjoying the ignorance is bliss camp. I have had it happen dozens of time to me with multiple foods.  However, I personally would rather be more informed about what I am putting into my body even if I had to get over my Altoids obsession.

Remember: your plant-based journey is nobody's but yours,"I recently moved into a new house. I've absolutely loved it so far, and one of the main reasons is that one of my roommates is vegan and has been for some years. So between me and her, it's very easy to be a vegetarian, and even make vegan meals most of the time! However, my other roommate has been rather judgmental about how I in particular eat. I occasionally eat chicken or fish for my own reasons, and still use butter and eggs and cheese in my cooking. On these occasions, she's openly criticized my food choices, going as far as calling me a ""bad vegan."" This has been pretty frustrating at times, since I am proud of my plant-based meals and how I have been working to reduce waste, improve my health with a more intentional diet, and make more earth-friendly choices. 

SO. My point in all of this is that we are all walking this path for our own reasons. Any effort to reduce our impact, support dignity for animals, and care for ourselves and the earth is a positive and helpful step in a compassionate direction. Not all vegetarians fall so neatly into the strict view of vegetarians. Some have to eat animal products for health or other reasons. It's nobody's damn business what we put into our bodies or how much or how frequently. If you haven't eaten animal products in 10+ years, awesome! If you are reducing how much meat you eat once a week, awesome! Everything helps and everyone's effort is important.

1) boil small potatoes (as soft as possible without getting mashed, so you can still make slices)

3) for the chutney (sauce), grind 1:1 ratio of cilantro and mint leaves, 2 small Thai chilis, a few drops of lemon and salt.
If you're close to an Indian store, you can get frozen coriander chutney too.

4) I used frozen parathas for the base. You could use  sandwich bread or whole wheat tortillas as well.
Make sure it's cooked well.

The waitstaff explained this merely meant the food doesn‚Äôt contain chicken, beef, etc.  I pointed out that this is not what vegetarian means.  They were mildly apologetic.  I think the menu should be revised to clearly indicate these items contain fish.  I don‚Äôt believe the restaurant is being intentionally deceptive,  but selling food to the public mislabeled as vegetarian is unethical.  

I am wondering if this is a reportable offense to a local health department or other regulatory body.  The restaurant is located in Virginia, USA. Has anyone had experience with a situation like this?",vegetarian,AllOutOfMP,1570464174,196,True,2019-10-07

Help to make my vegetarian food more filling,"Hey folks! My partner and I are going mostly vegetarian. I do the cooking, and I have a lot of good flavors that work well for us and that we enjoy eating. The problem is that the food I'm making now doesn't seem nearly as filling as before.

For example, grated cauliflower, cooked until soft, mixed with taco seasoning and black beans, slapped in a tortilla or into bell peppers. It's delicious, and kind of indistinguishable from the same but with ground beef.

It's just not filling though! I thought the problem was protein, but I put in quite a lot of black beans and I understand those are not low in protein. Does anyone else have this problem with veg recipes? Is there any common wisdom to making veg meals more filling?

9 vegetarian &amp; vegan protien substitutes,"Meatless Alternatives for Chicken, Beef and Fish

Eating a vegetarian diet is linked with many health benefits‚Äîincluding lower cholesterol, lower blood pressure and lower overall BMI. You'll want to make sure you're eating balanced meals and getting key nutrients that can sometimes be lacking for vegetarians and vegans, such as vitamin B12, iron and omega-3s. And whether you've just made the switch or want to shake up your dinner game, you may want some fresh ideas for what to eat. Beyond basic vegetables, fruits and whole grains, we've put together a list of our favorite vegetarian and vegan substitutes for animal proteins. These plant-based foods will help you skip the meat and still enjoy delicious meals.


Related: How Vegans Can Get the Key Nutrients They Need


1. Eggplant


Eggplant offers a meaty texture and an earthy, savory (umami) flavor. This versatile veggie can be prepared many ways, from grilling and baking to stir-frying and even stuffing (similar to a stuffed chicken breast). Try out these recipes for Stuffed Eggplant, Grilled Eggplant &amp; Baba Ghanoush and Eggplant-Shallot Stew.


2. Mushrooms


It's become quite popular to use portobello mushrooms as a substitute for a burger (like our Grilled Eggplant &amp; Portobello Sandwich), but mushrooms can do so much more. Chopped, sliced or ground mushrooms provide a meaty texture and earthy, smoky flavor that works well in the place of meat. Try your hand at subbing in mushrooms for meat in these recipes for Portobello ""Philly Cheese Steak"" Sandwich, Wild Mushroom &amp; Polenta Casserole and Asparagus &amp; Mushroom Risotto.


3. Tofu


Similar to chicken, this soy-based vegetarian protein takes on the flavors of what it is seasoned and cooked with. This makes tofu an excellent canvas for introducing all types of flavors (like our Tofu Curry, Tofu Stroganoff and Tofu Parmigiana, to name a few). Plus, a 3-ounce serving of tofu packs in 9 grams of protein.


4. Seitan


Sometimes referred to as ""the vegetarian white meat,"" this wheat-based protein is a great option and provides a similar mouthfeel to chicken (in fact, many imitation chicken products on the market are made with seitan). You can buy seitan where you find tofu in most large grocery stores. Try our recipe for Crispy Seitan Stir-Fry or Malaysian Seitan, Broccoli &amp; Mushroom Fried Rice to get you started.



5. Lentils


These legumes are surprisingly high in protein, with 9 grams per 1/2 cup (cooked). Their hearty texture and peppery flavor make them a good stand-in for ground beef in many recipes, such as Vegetarian Shepherd's Pie, Lentil Burgers and Squash, Chickpea &amp; Red Lentil Stew. Lentils come in a variety of colors including red, brown, black and green and ounce for ounce cost less than meat. You can buy them dried or canned.


6. Beans


Similar to lentils, beans are a good swap for beef in many recipes. Beans deliver around 8 grams of protein and 8 grams of fiber per 1/2-cup serving, though it may vary slightly depending on the type of bean. Top your salad with beans or use them in Vegetarian Chili or in place of meat in tacos and Vegetarian Taco Salad.


7. Tempeh


This soy-based protein is similar to tofu (which is also a great substitute for fish), but usually has a firmer texture, a darker brown color and a nutty flavor. Tempeh contains all the essential amino acids so it's a great vegetarian protein source and because it's fermented, it delivers probiotics (good bacteria essential for gut health). Tempeh is great grilled, as in our Grilled Tempeh Salad with Sesame-Ginger Dressing, or try it pan-fried in our Smothered Tempeh Sandwich and Sesame-Honey Tempeh &amp; Quinoa Bowl.


8. Jackfruit


It seems strange to think of a fruit as a substitute for meat, but the texture of jackfruit is actually quite similar to shredded chicken (and also works well in place of pulled pork). Though this tropical fruit looks intimidating from the outside, it's sold in supermarkets in cans and in the refrigerated section with other meat substitutes.


9. Cauliflower


Cauliflower is a mild vegetable and has a reputation for being able to stealthily replace certain foods, such as potatoes and even pizza crust. Vegans can enjoy ""egg"" salad by mashing cauliflower in this Vegan Cauliflower ""Egg"" Salad recipe. Caulifower also replaces the chicken in these Sriracha-Buffalo Cauliflower Bites and makes a healthy choice for ""meatballs"" in these Saucy Vegetarian Meatballs

Tragedy,"Was just eating at yardhouse. My fiancee and my favorite restaurant. We eat there weekly sometimes. The food is wondeful in general, but the gardein section of the menu is what makes it so easy for me. Today we had our first complaint and it is epic.  

I ordered the Gardein firecracker wings and devoured one as soon as it arrived. I noticed the taste to be off a tad but it just so happens this serving had the most sesame seeds I've ever seen it served with, and blamed the taste on that. (We had even had the first serving as an appetizers, this one was my entree) before I took my second bite, out of nowhere I realized that my dish was missing yardhouse's trademark wood stick that identifies the Gardein wings from the traditional boneless wings. My heart sank. ""Honey, is this real meat"" blood drains out of my face. He takes a bite, and this far into my horror story, I'm sure you have realized, it was indeed real chicken.  

Ran to the bathroom, didnt force myself to throw up and it didnt come naturally. Although the panic attack did, along with internal shakes and it coming up to my throat to sit where it still is. Manager was truly, painfully sincere about it and comped the whole meal.   

It's just so intense for me because it was the first meat I've eaten in seventeen fucking years. Probiotics, here I come.

Close to giving up,"I've been in love with meat(and cheese) for as long as I can remember. If mom cooked something without meat, I would be disappointed beyond words.
Even so, about a year and a half ago, I decided to try being vegetarian because I don't think it's fair that animal lives are lost just so I can live.
I understand that just by avoiding meat I am not solving anything, that those animals are alive just to be killed later anyway and that the chicken I used to eat wasn't taken out of his natural habitat or something. I just didn't want to be part of the process anymore.
I succeeded in being vegetarian for that year and a half, but now I'm having second thoughts. Reasons? I gained weight, I'm always hungry and lately I've been seriously tempted to eat meat.
More than anything, I'm having a moral struggle with the fact that after all meat is murder.

Hemorrhoids after I stopped eating meat? :(,"Hey y‚Äôall. 

Experimented with vegetarianism every now and then since I was 16. A month here, four months there, etc. Never made it longer than six months because I‚Äôd get stomach problems and my BM would get wack as fuck. 

I‚Äôm 21 now and I‚Äôve only eaten meat once or twice since March. It was fine for a while, then started to become a nuisance, and now it‚Äôs a problem. 

I eat processed foods from time to time (like veg burgs and other meatless options, and some junk food) but for the most part I eat rice, beans, and vegetables. 

Also, I do drink a lot of caffeine; usually the equivalent of 3-4 cups of coffee. And I drink all caffeine: tea, coffee, yerba mate, energy drinks. I also smoke a half pack a day and about 1g of weed, but I don‚Äôt think those things would interfere with my digestion that much. 

And my drug habits have been like that for the past 2 years or so. It‚Äôs only when I stop eating meat that I get these stomach problems. 

Can anyone offer me any advice? Like I‚Äôm seriously considering going back to eating meat because of how my health has been affected, even though meat absolutely disgusts me now and I plan on cutting out all animal products by the end of next year. 

My shits are literally holding me back.

Grilled Teriyaki Chicken Salad :),"Ingredients:

¬Ω cup teriyaki sauce,

4 boneless skinless chicken breasts, pounded to even thickness

8 cups chopped romaine or green leaf lettuce

¬Ω cup cherry tomatoes, halved

¬º red onion, thinly sliced

2 avocados, sliced

1 15-ounce can pineapple rings, with juice (juice divided between marinade and dressing, see instructions)

cilantro, roughly chopped


Dressing:

¬Ω cup teriyaki sauce

‚Öì cup rice vinegar or apple cider vinegar

‚Öì cup olive oil

pineapple juice (from the can of pineapple rings)


Instructions:

Combine chicken, ¬Ω cup teriyaki sauce, and half of the pineapple juice from your can of pineapple slices in a large resealable bag. Press the extra air out of the bag, seal, and chill for 15 minutes.

In a small-medium bowl combine all dressing ingredients, whisk to combine, then cover and chill until ready to use.

Grease and preheat your grill. Place chicken on grill and discard bag with marinade. Place chicken and pineapple rings on the grill. Grill pineapple rings just until hot and tender and grill marks start to form. Grill chicken 6-10 minutes on each side until browned and cooked all the way through (completely white inside, no pink). Transfer to cutting board and slice into strips or chop into 1-inch pieces.


Assemble salads with chopped lettuce on the bottom, then top with chicken, tomatoes, onions, avocado slices, grilled pineapple slices and cilantro. Serve with prepared dressing (stir or shake immediately before serving). Top with sesame seeds if desired. The thicker the teriyaki sauce, the better.

Looking for info on environmental/ethical comparisons of various animal products,"I'm an ex-vegetarian who is considering cutting down or cutting out meat and potentially other animal products. My concern is around ethics of farming plus environment and health (when I was a vegetarian it was at first a simpler 'killibg is wrong' but by the end of it I felt e.g. free range meat was better than battery eggs and ultimately my concern was welfare rather than rights/life.

I've heard different accounts of the relative welfare issues of meat v dairy/eggs and also seen some environmental concerns around some veggie/vegan alternative proteins (soy?) Instinctively I'd assume eating beef is worse environmentally but better ethically than eating chicken (partially conditions, partially just that one cow feeds more than one chicken. But not sure whether e.g. free range meat from small ethical farms is preferable to the vast majority of cheese from mass produced milk.

Are there any sources that weigh up the relative environmental/welfare coats of various animal products? 

As a side note back when I was veggie it was understood that to be healthy as a vegan you needed a very fine tuned range of proteins plus maybe supplements.

So that isn't really a reason for me. I'm more concerned with the health benefits and the environmental benefits of it. If you guys could help me out with some information regarding that, I'd greatly appreciate it.

Leading questions
1. Is meat really bad for you?
2. People say vegetarians don't get all the nutrients they need. Is this true? Is there an easy way to fix this if so?
3. Is it feasible to assume that me being a vegetarian really makes enough of a difference for the environment to be worth the changes I would have to put my wife through as far as shopping and meal planning? She would not be making the same choice.

First B12 injection today,"I've been vegetarian for about two and a half years now and never had any health concerns before this last summer where I began to feel fatigued and lost the motivation to cook quality meals. I still cook occasionally, but as my stomach aches got worse, I didn't have the appetite to make real food and would make Morningstar dinners. After a bunch of tests and finally blood work, we found that I had low (not dangerously, but still low) B12 levels. I'm gonna be on B12 injections for 6 months and then we'll see if I can switch over to just supplements. I would've thought I was doing fine because I always tried to make an effort to eat non-meat products with the vitamin in it, but my assumption was misguided.

Petition to ban posts that contain references to eating meat.,"Please hear me out - I expect a lot of downvotes, but I hope you'll give me a chance.

This is a vegetarian sub. I am always SO glad to see anyone who is making baby steps towards a plant-based lifestyle, but this sub is for vegetarian specific content. 

If you are an omni looking for veg recipes, heck yeah. 

If you are someone casually interested in vegetarianism, and want some tips - I'm all about it. 

But today there was a post about being pescatarian, and it had over 250 upvotes and about 70 comments talking about how eating meat is okay when its X animal or in moderation. 

There are subs to talk about those topics. This is not the sub. There are people here who are plant-based for a variety of reasons...but the point is that we don't eat meat. We don't talk about eating meat. And we, for sure, don't say that salmon lives don't matter as much as a cow, so you can eat them (a literal quote from that thread.)

These posts are quiet common, and are becoming more frequent. IMO we don't need to know how frequently (if ever) you eat meat. We don't need to know that you eat it once a week, once a month, or never. Were just here to share tips, recipes, and other advice for a plant-based diet. If you eat meat still, or your transitioning, I get it. Just maybe save those details for another thread, and be mindful of animal abuse concerns some people in this group have. 

Thoughts? I'm interested to hear other viewpoints.

Soft texture meals,"Hello vegetarian friends, I am in need of a little assistance.

I've had sharp pain in the back of my mouth for a while and I thought it was probably my wisdom teeth, I scheduled an appointment with the face surgeon and was okay with the fact that I'll need to eat only soup and the like for about ten days.

Well I get to my appointment, and lo and behold, my teeth are alright and I have CMD - basically, my chewing muscle is extremely tense, I need physical therapy for it, and in the meantime I'm forbidden to eat bread, most raw vegetables and anything that is hard to chew. First of all, I am angry about the bread because this is THE breakfast around here (Germany).

I've been making soups, rice with cooked vegetables, and a lot of potatoes and cauliflower mash, but I've been miserable for days now. I can't have any chickpeas - my favourite bean - unless I've made them into hummus and while I make a very good hummus, I don't know how to eat it without fresh veg or bread. My partner doesn't like most kinds of pasta, his favourite is made with meatless meatballs, which are too hard for me to chew. 

My physical therapy begins at the end of October and will continue on for two weeks. I will probably need to stick to this meal plan for longer than that. And I desperately need some ideas to add to it. Ideally I hope someone has had CMD or something similar and can share the experience with me. I avoid dairy and eggs (I would make an exception for eggs from SO's parents' hens but they are not laying any right now) and absolutely cannot eat cilantro (coriander seeds are fine though) or grapefruit.

The Food Hierarchy: Where is Vegetarianism and its Many Types?,"Plenty of people tend to get vegetarian food confused with all other types of dietary restrictions, so I thought I'd do this, with a semi-rigorous mathematical treatment. 

First off, we have the **universal set, Œæ** of **all food _typically_ consumed by people**. I'm certain I'll get pedants here talking about cannibalism and other extreme, exotic and highly hygienic varieties of consumables like Tide Pods, but here I am limiting food to a cultural majority. This, however, means things like insects and dog dicks (apparently a Chinese delicacy) are fair game in this set.

Then, we have three popular dietary restrictions as a result of religion: Kosher, Halal and Hindu food. Kosher and Halal food have much in common, such as the prohibition of pork, the handling of meat, et cetera. The list is too long to elaborate here, and I am neither Jewish nor Muslim, so I cannot claim to know the complete list of prohibited food items.

Hindu food is *almost always* devoid of beef (though, like everything else in Hinduism, there exists a sect that does their own thing). 

A **subset** of the set intersection of these three sets is **pescetarianism**: all plant-based food, dairy, eggs, and seafood is allowed. Personally I find this a rather odd distinction to make, but I suppose people who restrict themselves to these are likely allergic to poultry and bovine/porcine meat. 

Now, things get more complicated. 

We start with **ovo-lacto-vegetarianism** (I'm gonna use OLV, because it's a pain to re-type), which is the group that this subreddit is most familiar with, methinks. This is a subset of pescetarianism, and it means people eat eggs, dairy (of course, cheese *without* bovine rennet), plant material, and animal-derived plant material, like honey. Assuming ingredients are appropriately chosen and the food appropriately cooked, OLV food is a **strict** subset of **both** Kosher and Halal food‚Äîso if you have *never, ever* had meat or eggs in your household (like mine), the food you cook is A-OK to be served to Jews and Muslims (any Jews and Muslims here, please correct me on this if I'm wrong).

Then things move to **lacto-vegetarianism** (LV), also called Hindu vegetarianism. This is because nearly everyone who is vegetarian in the world lives in India, is Hindu, and is lacto-vegetarian. As the name suggests, this set here is excludes eggs, making it a strict subset of OLV. 

Beneath lacto-vegetarianism, things don't *immediately* get to veganism. Oh, no. Indian religions have a whole story planned for you. 

Jain food is a strict subset of LV food, and doesn't include vegetables of the genus *Allium* (read: onions, garlic, leeks, etc.). There are said to be multiple reasons for this, all typically stemming from Vedic interpretations of the effects of food on the body‚Äîapparently such vegetables are aphrodisiacs. Another oft-cited reason is that these are root vegetables (sometimes *other* root vegetables are disallowed, too, like potatoes, yams, carrots, etc), and harvesting them effectively kills the entire plant, thus violating the Hindu/Buddhist/Jain tenet of non-violence, or *ahimsa*. 

Buddhist vegetarians tend to follow this diet, too. Many Hindu vegetarians also adhere to this diet on certain holy days like Navaratri, the anniversary of a family member's passing, etc. Whether this entire *Allium*- and root-vegetable-avoiding idea was originally a Hindu one, or re-imported back from Jainism or Buddhism, is unclear. However, depending on the sect in question, dairy still tends to be allowed. 

Obviously, vegans can and do eat *Allium* vegetables, so Jain vegetarian food is not *really* a superset of **vegan** food, which everyone knows‚Äî*nothing*, not even the clothes on one's back, from animals or animal-derived effort, etc. So we have things like vegan cheese, Beyond, Impossible, Morningstar, there exist hundreds of Western brands of meat imitations catering to vegans (I personally hardly ever eat stuff like this, because who needs fake meat when you have Indian food? ^(just kidding please don't pitchfork me, I like fake meat too)). 

Beneath veganism there's fruitarianism, where people only eat the fruiting bodies of plants. Steve Jobs was purportedly on this diet. Sounds intense, and I doubt I could ever live like this (unless I was on a remote island).",vegetarian,delta_p_delta_x,1570695900,4,True,2019-10-10

Hunting and environment,"Hello together,

First of all: I am no vegetarian and honestly, I am not planning to become one. I am thinking of eating less meat and perhaps only high-quality dairy products.
But there are a few topics about vegetarian lifestyle that go through my head, perhaps you can clarify a bit for me:

Hunting: if a vegetarian mainly wants to eat less meat to improve life for lifestock (cows and so on) he eats cheese and milk. He does not necessarily buy the products that care for the animals most. On the other hand, (at least here in Germany) there are meat products where you can be sure about this. Let‚Äôs say you buy deer meat from a hunter who only hunts to regulate the numbers and buy sausages from that meat as well. (The deer would have had a totally natural life until then) Would it not be technically better for the animals to leave away mass-produced milk and eat a deer steak every now and then (as flexitarian)?

Ecological topics: if you replace meat by soy and this soy is produced eg in Brazil , as far as I know, there is a high risk, that the transport produced a lot of CO2 and that the land is gained by destroying rain forest. Honest question: is this a conflict of interest or is this still a better CO2 deal than eating meat? 

Long topic short: wouldn‚Äôt it sometimes be better for the whole planet to compromise about meat and dairy products in order to find a good middle between not harming animals and producing less CO2? 
Is there a set of rules that fit into this thinking?

Thank you for your thoughts , I am honestly curious üòä",vegetarian,Django-UN,1571051131,11,True,2019-10-14

As a long-time vegetarian who is now been vegan for a while, I wanted to talk about how I have noticed that there are some people in the vegan community who chastise put down and even hate vegetarians. This way of thinking is so wrong. (If anyone cares to look , Anonymous for the voiceless posted yesterday on there Facebook that ‚Äúvegetarians are meat eaters‚Äù I made a whole video (which I did not watch)about how bad vegetarians are and how meat eaters cause less harm. When I was a vegetarian I did not eat much eggs I had only made a quiche about three times over the course of five years. I would eat a muffin or a baked good that may contain eggs but either than that I did not like eggs. I would go to Pizza Hut and get a mushroom pizza I would go to Dunkin‚Äô Donuts and have cream in my coffee and I would have regular ice cream (all things I also did when I ate meat) only time I would put cheese on my food would be when I would make Italian food and that would probably be about once a week. I was never a big cheese person and even when I ate meat I would always get a hamburger not a cheeseburger.  I would also eat regular candy bars but I would always prefer dark chocolate. I would eat a lot of tofu and a lot of my meals were accidentally vegan. I‚Äôd love Mock meat substitutes and ate/still eat lots of rice and pasta. 
According to them vegetarians eat eggs and cheese for most of their diet and they also eat seafood. I had to explain to them multiple times that fish is not vegetarian because fish including shellfish is definitely meat. Just because there are idiots calling them selves vegetarian when they eat fish DOES NOT MEAN IT‚ÄôS VEGETARIAN. Also according to them most meat eaters eat mostly plant-based diet, but  will have a steak a few times a month. Notice this way of thinking on Reddit as well. I talk to them about why don‚Äôt you educate them about using baking substitute in place of eggs when you‚Äôre cooking or baking. And about the great variety and great taste of non-dairy milk these days. But no they just want to chastise and disparage people. Add to that that many people will become vegetarian and then go vegan but no they don‚Äôt care. They also don‚Äôt want to acknowledge that it‚Äôs harder to go vegan and that there‚Äôs a lot of trace amounts of dairy products in snack foods or every day items and it‚Äôs much harder to avoid days than to just stop eating meat.

"Nuts (e.g., almonds, Brazilian) going bad","Hi, 

I find that nuts are a good source of healthy fat. This is useful as I wish to gain weight while on a vegetarian diet. 

I recently began to eat Brazilian nuts which I buy from the bulk food section of the grocery store. I store them in my pantry, and bring them to school and eat during the day as a snack. 

I have noticed however, that some of them taste bad. But it's impossible to tell unless you taste them. 

This past weekend, I had terrible diarrhea after eating a few nuts (although to be fair, I also ate a few digestive biscuits and salty crackers, so it's hard to tell which caused it). The nuts in question were bought less than 2 weeks ago, and I live in Vancouver, not some tropical climate (though I do have my heat on). This is the only diarrhea I have had since I began to eat Brazilian nuts 1-2 months ago. 

Regardless, do you guys think the nuts were already bad at the time I bought them, or did they go bad because of the way I stored them? (should I have put them in the fridge?). 

I do not want to give up eating nuts because they have the nutrients I need. But at the same time, I do not want to eat any bad nuts, and have diarrhea. Any suggestions on how to avoid buying/eating nuts? Should I buy those that come in in sealed boxes (rather than from the bulk food section)? Should I keep them in the fridge once I am at home? And if they are stored in the fridge, would it still be ok for them to be put in a normal lunch box, and eaten during the day while I am at school?

Lack of Support from family,"I become a vegetarian because of my very recent pregnancy I would throw up everytime I tried and sometimes the smell would cause it as well. So I consulted my doctors and I made the switch. I found support in YouTubers for ideas and Pinterest and actually had alot of fun and take alot of pride in the meals I was making and how delicious they are. 

My SO was supportive during my pregnancy he just ate out when he wanted meat. My parents at least keep something simple for me at there house like a box Mac n cheese or veg burgers. I even said I'll cook it myself. His family however think vegetarians are a regression, because we only became more intelligent by consuming meat and that's why humans advanced the way they do. When they order everything has meat in it and I'm being told to just pick around it the only thing I could eat that didn't have meat was a tiny bowl of plain rice. 

However now that I am no longer pregnant within the week everyone was pushing me to eat meat again. I did try it but it doesn't taste good anymore and upset my stomach soo much. I keep being told to power through the pain so I can eat it again. I'm feeling so much pressure from every one around me to go back but I am happy being a vagatarian it's something I've wanted to be since I was little but didn't have the proper knowledge on how do it in a healthy way.

Do you all eat a similar microwavable product to this that's vegetarian-friendly? If so, what is it? If I google ""vegetarian teriyaki chow mein"" all that shows up is the product I'm talking about or recipes.

Was Steve Irwin a jerk?,"Hello all,

I'm honestly curious what the consensus here is. I know Reddit seems to love Steve Irwin and I have almost no problem with that, but as an older redditor who came of age in the 1990s when South Park and others would make fun of him, this reverence does seem a little cult-like (I'm not glad he's dead and I feel bad for his son and wife, but I do remember a time when we could talk about the guy like a regular human). 

Anyway, my position is, he didn't seem to add much to science or humanity's understanding of any animals. He DID seem to amass personal fame and wealth by exploiting and harassing harmful animals. This seems like a dick move to me, and I honestly can't see why he's so revered. 

Am I crazy? Did he contribute a lot to our understanding of snakes and crocodiles and things? (I'm not being facetious here; it's just I remember his animal planet show in the 1990s was mostly him poking at snakes or wrestling crocodiles and even then, before I was a vegetarian, I was confused at the purpose of the whole thing). In fact, it seems to me, one could make a good argument that Mr. Irwin inspired a bunch of fan boys who want to go fuck with/hunt/cage wild animals.

Finally, just so it's clear it's not personal from me, I'm also against zoos and other nature shows where humans just fuck with wild animals. 

My general position is, unless you are a legit scientist, leave wild animals alone if at all possible. Same with wild places; leave them alone, too.",vegetarian,pol_pots,1567565346,13,True,2019-09-03
Advice for someone wanting to become vegetarian?,"Hey everyone, I am new to Reddit so I apologize in advance as I‚Äôm sure this has been asked millions of times (I‚Äôm still trying to figure out how to use the app). 

Anyway I am moving in about 10 days and moving very close to a Whole Foods and other health food stores/restaurants and I‚Äôve been contemplating becoming vegetarian, and I think being within walking distance of more food options is good timing to make another change: my diet. I guess I am just not sure how or where to begin. How did you start, if any of you remember or don‚Äôt mind sharing?

I‚Äôve found I‚Äôm feeling more and more gross eating certain meats and it‚Äôs not just mental/emotional, but physical too.

What advice do you have for someone who wants to become vegetarian and doesn‚Äôt know how to begin, and is frankly, kind of afraid of change?

Opinion on mock-meats - want to hear yours,"Hi all! Don't mean to ignite flames, just here for your opinions :)

As a life-long vegetarian, I've found this new/recent trend on ""plant-based meats"" a bit amusing. While I wholeheartedly support more people turning vegetarian or at least eating more vegetarian food - sometimes I don't get it.

When I'm looking for food, I look for vegetarian options because I can't really stand the idea of eating meat (as in me myself, it's fine if others do). So getting food that's ""as good as the original thing"" meat doesn't really turn me hungrier, it makes me feel a bit uneasy for eating meat, if that makes any sense? Maybe I'm overthinking it.

But I would much rather have 5x more vegetarian/vegan options in any menu, based around just tofu, or paneer, or other proteins for what they are rather than gmo products resembling something else. 

What are your thoughts on this - or do you actually prefer the notion of mock meats to get more people hopefully eating better?

PS : The one thing I'm glad for, is that I can get more protein concentrated food in this new trend, though I still feel strange eating it. Couldn't they just call it something else?",vegetarian,ResidentYak6,1567643582,27,True,2019-09-04

friend didn't tell me homemade food had chicken in it,"So one of my closest friends moved away relatively recently. She came back in town and I went over to her mothers place to hangout and see her off before she left again. They're from Mexico and her mother mainly speaks Spanish. My best friend wanted to eat lunch at her house (her mother was making a Mexican meal) before she left and obviously since I'd been there for a few hours they wanted me to eat with them. My friend let her mother know I was a vegetarian, we had the whole talk with her mother that I don't eat any meat and yes that also means I don't eat chicken. Her mother let us know I could eat the mashed potatoes and veggies she had as left overs. So we're eating and my friend asks her mother in Spanish how she makes the mashed potatoes and I overhear (they don't think I know much Spanish, which I don't) that it was made with chicken broth. I asked my friend casually then if it was made with sour cream and she was like no, it's made with milk. Which was true, I overheard that it was made with milk and chicken; she just left out the fact that it was made with chicken too. 

I continued to eat and finished the meal because I felt like it would've been rude to stop eating the meal or to seem put off by it (because I'm sure this was just an honest mistake) and I didn't want to come off as rude to her culture. Also because her mother is going through financial troubles and I feel like it would be extremely rude to turn away food I had already started eating in that case as well. 

So now I'm a bit frustrated with my friend I guess. I'm frustrated that she didn't tell me in that moment when I'd asked what it was made with and I'm frustrated that she didn't at least tell me afterwards. And I don't know if that's fair of me to be frustrated. Because I'm assuming she didn't say anything at the time or after because she didn't want to upset me or offend me or was afraid of how I'd react and offending her mother? But then why not tell me afterwards? I've been a vegetarian for over 10 years at this point so when people aren't honest with me about something having meat in it it really bothers me. It feels like they don't respect my values at all when they can't even be honest with me about it. Or it feels like she doesn't trust me at all to handle the situation with grace by not telling me. So I'm frustrated. I'm doubly frustrated because just days prior we'd gotten into an argument and I told her I need her to tell me things. That stupid things aren't a big deal and I don't care but I need her to tell me things so I know what's going on (she does this to a lot of people and it blows up in her face sometimes and I guess it was just the first time she'd done it to me). So it feels like the same problem we just talked about in another manner if that makes sense. Where she just isn't quite as forthcoming and honest with shit as she should be. I don't know, if you consider me your best friend why aren't you just honest with me?

Ughhh sorry. What do you guys think? Am I being crazy? Am I being too entitled? Should I say something? Part of me feels like I shouldn't because she's moved away but we're close enough that we still talk almost every day. And this bothers me.

How to ‚Äòcome out‚Äô as vegetarian?,"OK, so I‚Äôm a teenaged boy and so I‚Äôm full of all those hormones and stuff - and I‚Äôm at the stage in life where I eat a lot, including, until recently, meat.

My family is a big meat eating family and so I never really thought to make a switch until now. But I not only have started to dislike the taste of meat, but I‚Äôve been getting some bad feedback from my heart, despite being 17Ôºåphysically active and not eating sugar. I think that it may be due to the amount of meat that I eat.

How do I tell my parents about this choice that I‚Äôve decided to make? I‚Äôve thought about it a lot, and I‚Äôve decided - but I‚Äôm worried that they will either think that I‚Äôm joking, or worse, try to talk me out of it.

I‚Äôd love some advice, thanks in advance for your help.

Ate meat and feel instant regret,"Hello all. Preface I guess lol I've been a vegetarian since June 2018. I'm a cook, chef in training I suppose so I'm working with meat daily. I went veg mostly just to expose myself to new foods and better grow my palate, so it's not like a moral reason or anything. But the temptations are so high working where I do and I get teased about it constantly. So last night we had a massive supply of mussels that didn't sell and were on the verge of going bad... so I caved. I made myself some sort of random pasta dish with them and all night I was on the fence about doing it or not and after the fact I feel so much guilt about it. It was an amazing meal but at the same time the meat added... basically nothing. Kinda reminded me why I went veg to begin with as I've totally learned just how little meat actually adds to a good dish...   


Just yeah? Like I'm really wishing I didn't do it because I've been taking pride in being meat free(especially when surrounded by macho man bacon stuffing meat freaks at work) and that was so not worth it.

Factoring everything in, it was about a 40% savings in cost over getting an Impossible Whopper meal.

[Vent/Rant] constantly mocked for being a vegetarian.,"I've been a vegetarian for 3 years, and for the most part I keep it to myself other than when I go out to get food with people because ill ask the waiter(ess) if they can remove the meat from the dish, or if they have any vegetarian options and I don't keep it to myself because I'm embarrassed but just because I don't feel the need to talk about it unless the subject comes up.

For the most part I don't care how other people feel about me being a vegetarian, I've heard it all before ""Well you're still killing plants"", ""Its pointless"", ""You can still be healthy while eating meat"", ""We're meant to eat meat"" yadah yadah yadah, but normally what shuts people up is when I say ""Its my life, why do you care so much?"" 

But what gets under my skin the most is all the stupid ass ""jokes"" and comments that I hear every single god damn day.  If I hear a joke every now and again, whatever but when I can't even sit down and just eat my food in peace without having some comment made at me that's when I get pissed off. 

For example, not too long ago for lunch I had brought rice and vegetables, in a jar. I don't remember the conversation exactly but it was something about his handwriting and how it was harder to read than someone else and his comment was ""Oh well all the vegetables you're eating is blurring your vision, that's why you cant tell you vegan"", not only that but constantly the people that i'm around always makes a comment about what i'm eating and say ""oh your nasty vegan food"" or ""oh well since you're a vegan you can only eat rocks, since you'll be killing the grass"" (when I've repeatedly clarified that i'm not vegan) or talk about how ""malnourished"".

Then repeatedly i'll ask for them to just knock it off and leave me alone about it, but they just insist on continuing it and its so frustrating and irritating. All I want is to sit down and eat in peace without being reminded every damn second that I don't eat meat. What also bothers me even more is that when they call me a vegan as an insult. It's just so childish and again their ""jokes"" aren't funny, and this has been going on for 2 years and i'm tired of it. In the past I've brought this up in a different subreddit on an account (that is now deleted, as well as the post) and people were siding with the people that always mock me for it saying that ""its their obligation to make fun of me because I don't eat meat"", and that I was the one for being childish because I was getting irritated about it, like c'mon for 2 years I've asked for this to stop but they don't care.

Also its not like I could completely get away from them either, they're my teammates so I see them practically everyday, and its the fact that its constant I hear this shit every single day and its annoying, now if it was like once every other week or once a month okay whatever but everyday it just gets so draining.

People who eat meat calling themselves vegetarian?,"Hey all,

I‚Äôm a vegetarian and have been since I was 13 (I‚Äôm in my 20‚Äôs). It‚Äôs a moral thing for me, and I‚Äôve never intentionally eaten meat since I gave it up. I‚Äôve been accidentally served meat at restaurants a couple times, but it wasn‚Äôt intentional and I always make myself throw up because I want to. I just can‚Äôt stand the thought of meat being in my body as it‚Äôs, like I said, a moral thing.

I‚Äôve met many people at this point who call themselves ‚Äúvegetarian, I only eat meat once a month‚Äù or ‚Äúvegetarian, I only eat meat when I‚Äôm drunk LOL‚Äù. Does anyone else find this insanely offensive? Trust me I party and get drunk too but I don‚Äôt eat meat no matter how drunk I am because IM A VEGETARIAN! 

I can‚Äôt stand this. It‚Äôs insulting. And it‚Äôs stupid... a vegetarian by definition is someone who doesn‚Äôt eat meat. You factually ARE NOT vegetarian if you sometimes eat meat on purpose. It‚Äôs fair to say your diet is mostly plant based or something like that, but there‚Äôs no such thing as ‚Äúmostly vegetarian‚Äù. That‚Äôs an illogical phrase and I‚Äôm so annoyed that people think it‚Äôs acceptable to call themselves vegetarian if the purposefully eat meat.

3)  How has converting impacted your social life? For instance, has it been difficult to go out to eat with friends/family who are not vegetarian/vegan?  Have your friends/family been supportive?

4)  Have you found it difficult to find options when eating out?

5)  What do you think restaurants can do better to accommodate vegetarians/vegans?  For instance - Have vegetarian/vegan options of their existing menu items?  Clear or better labeling of what menu items are vegetarian/vegan?",vegetarian,WBVersion3,1568306863,18,True,2019-09-12

Accidentally Ate Meat!!,"Hello everyone!!


I am quite disappointed in myself and wanted to share. I went to a restaurant and got a veggie plate as I often do, with all sides that traditionally do not have meat (or so I thought!!).

I was happily eating and to my dismay, looked down to see a piece of sausage on my fork from the rice and beans! I began to look through it and there were several more pieces. The rice and beans was so flavorful I couldn't even tell and I was chatting so at the restaurant that I wasn't paying much attention.

Eating at a Seafood Restaurant while being vegetarian,"Hello all, looking to hear from your point of view..
Here is some background: I'm vegetarian who doesn't eat onion/garlic and nothing cross contaminated with meat. 
In a long distance relationship where I rarely get to hang out with bf but when we do he is accommodating to where I eat, he states he rarely gets to eat at places he likes when we are together so we eat at a couple same places.

This coming week when I hang out with him, his family insists on going to a seafood restaurant despite my bf trying to convince them to go elsewhere. I've called the restaurant and the only thing that seems to go with my diet are the vegetables. Aside from being not too comfortable eating around a bunch of crab legs and shrimp, there's nothing much to eat so I'll be staring at everyone's food. And it's going to cost a whopping $40 which my bf will most likely cover but it's a stack of money for vegetables. My bf may not want to go if I don't go but I want him to be with his family whom he hasn't seen in over a year. 

I've thought of many ways to go about this such as eating beforehand and having dessert, not going and finding an event to attend, etc.. I feel like Im thinking too much into it.

I was the type of person that liked the idea of becoming vegetarian for ethical and environmental reasons but couldn‚Äôt succeed more than a day - I ate meat typically once or twice a day every day!  I also enjoyed eating meat and couldn‚Äôt imagine cutting out a steak or chicken wings. This past summer I had thought about not eating meat more and more. I have always loved animals but was able to be differentiate the meat I was eating from the animal I was seeing. One day I just couldn‚Äôt make that differentiation anymore and felt so guilty and horrified with the sensation of chewing meat. I decided to try to gradually cut back on meat and see how I felt, and then possibly stop eating it altogether. 

I thought that since I was so reliant on meat in my meals that it would be difficult to transition but it was so easy to cut back that after a three or four days of not eating meat or even wanting it, I felt like maybe I should just go as long as I could without eating it. After about two weeks it wasn‚Äôt about seeing how long I could go. It just felt like the lifestyle for me.

How can I convince my family to (at least) go flexitarian?,"Hi Everyone,

I'm seventeen, so I still live with my parents, and it is my job to cook dinner for them which I don't mind because I have a passion for it. I cook separate dinners, three meat-based meals that my family asks me to prepare and a plant-based meal for myself. I don't like touching the meat but I have to as I usually am requested to dry rub it, season it, the works. I've recently become interested in convincing my family in eating less meat as I converted for ethical reasons, but I am only now learning about the environmental and health factors.

Lately my dad has been showing interest in becoming a vegetarian. I made the entire family beyond meat burgers as a treat one night and my mom and dad loved them (my brother liked them until I told them they were beyond meat haha.) I do not cook them often as I do not agree with how much packaging they are in and how they aren't the best for you (but they're still really good.) My dad was surprised to hear how processed they were as well but I told him that a study from CBC found that they were about as bad for you as meat burgers and he was surprised. He recently told my mom he thinks that ""maybe one day in the future I'd like to go vegetarian"" which I'm super happy about for him, however he is still super interested in meat and I believe that he might prefer going flexitarian for a while. (flexitarians are people who eat meat less often)

My mom has a condition called lupus which causes flares of pain that can be worsened by high inflammatory foods such as meat (but not fish.) I've asked her before if she'd ever consider trying a vegetarian diet and she told me she had in the nineties but had stopped because he anemia was getting in the way. I wonder if she'd try going pescatarian or flexitarian as well? Much less inflammatory foods and she would be able to get protein from fish and veggies, nuts etc. I know she is reluctant and doesn't believe much in iron from plant based sources, as whenever I cook vegetarian for the entire family (which is about once every two months) she will sometimes ask me to add meat to her meals even though there is tofu, lentils, beans etc in her meal. 

My brother will not be on the same page however. He likes to lie and come up with sh\*t on the spot to try to ""convert me back"" such as telling me that produce grown without gmos is worse for the environment than meat, meat eaters are healthier and slimmer blah blah blah. He is a little overweight which is ironic, but I am sure he'd be impossible to try the flexitarian diet so I probably won't try lol.

Is there anyway I could maybe talk to my parents (politely) about it? Have you ever tried to convince your parents/relatives/friends to try something similar?",vegetarian,polipodo,1568664003,9,True,2019-09-16

Misinformed and Misleading Vegans,"[I don‚Äôt eat animals]
It‚Äôs speculated that we evolved because we Did eat animals. Otherwise we‚Äôd still be up in the trees and we wouldn‚Äôt be here sharing our lifestyles with strangers on the Internet. I‚Äôm a vegetarian but I know that animals DO get killed in the clearing of land used to grow our crops. Vegans lie and say that‚Äôs only for grain farms to feed live stock but they Are lying. I‚Äôm a vegetarian but honestly it‚Äôs WAY BETTER FOR THE PLANET if we actually grew our own food. Otherwise you ARE supporting animal death. How many bugs and small animals died to grow our vegetables and fruits? I don‚Äôt know the exact number but if you say none... you‚Äôre lying. If you wanna start growing your own veggies I highly recommend the kratkey method of hydroponics. It uses less water and no electricity is necessary (you can just put it in front of a window). I do recommend getting some LED grow lights, though (you don‚Äôt need fancy ones). And I‚Äôd just like to add that you shouldn‚Äôt just people who hunt for food because guess what... they‚Äôre not relying on factory farms and it‚Äôs not bad for the environment (climate change is a result of a large population which relies on large scale production and agriculture). A good hunter is smart enough to not go after endangered species because they know they‚Äôll be hungry tomorrow and they deserve to eat just as much as anyone else does. Most vegans rely on commercial agriculture which, again, kills animals. Growing your own food, growing what you want and need, will lead to less waste of all our natural resources. So don‚Äôt say you‚Äôre a vegan if you contribute to the death of animals by what you put in your mouth! Genuine veganism is much deeper and more difficult than vegans lead on. Just know that everyone with an agenda has just that, an agenda. Our planet is not designed to hold billions of people who constantly need to consume on such a large, greedy scale. Honestly, if you wanna save the planet, the best way to do it is for humans to come together and not make any babies even just for a year, until we can solve some of these very pressing issues which threaten all those babies futures anyway. It‚Äôs simple logic.

I posted this in a comment on Instagram, but I know it‚Äôs too important to share to not be seen. I hope this will be seen and people will be more properly informed about their impact.",vegan,commie4u,1577742251,0,True,2019-12-30
Is eating road kill meat ethical?,"So I was listening to a radio program while driving. They had a former vegan on who currently lives in Alaska. She reintroduced meat into her diet because where she lives, road kill of (moose and deer) are salvaged for human consumption.

People place their names on a list and are contacted when an animal is killed roadside. Said people drive out to the location to salvage the meat.

The argument is that letting the meat go to waste is unethical. The animal is not harmed intentionally and the meat does not go to waste. The flip side was that respect for the animal should be considered regardless.

Bad start,"Whenever I think back on this I cringe. In about 2 weeks I'll be celebrating a year as a vegetarian. A few months after vegetarianism I started towards veganism by cutting out milk and cheese and slowly but surely have worked up to full vegan. 

But before I went vege I decided I'd have a ""last hurrah"" and went to a BBQ place with friends and loaded up on meat because I'd "" miss it"". A big part of my decision was I knew how poorly they treated animals before they ..you know killed them. And yet in my head just one more meal couldn't hurt. No idea what I was thinking and I look back on myself like a different person. 

Anyway my point is I know a lot of people are probably considering going vegan in the new year and are maybe going to think like me. My advise is don't do it. Rather than that spend your money by going and trying a really nice vegan restaurant instead and celebrate your new life.",vegan,sierra117x,1577743051,3,True,2019-12-30

Vegan Pregnancy - bad teeth,"I've been vegan for a few years, and recently had a baby boy. He's 10 months old now, and has yellow patches on the 4 teeth that have come through. 

It actually looks like a section of the enamel itself is missing. I'll be taking him to the dentist next week, but from what I've researched on the internet I'm pretty sure it's a condition called enamel hypoplasia. 

I've been down a rabbit-hole researching this, and it's lead me to vitamin K2. It's important for teeth development, and although the body can convert some K1 (found in veggies) to K2 (found in animal products), it seems like scientists are starting to doubt the efficiency of that. The research seems pretty new - K2 was only discovered in 2007 or something. 

I was diligent in planning all the usual nutritients you hear about - B12, D, calcium, etc. Buy I just hadn't heard or thought about K2.

Has anyone else experienced this? I have found other similar stories elsewhere but I don't know how representative it is. Or, anyone who was vegan throughout pregnancy whose kids have great teeth?

My Vitamin &amp; Mineral Supplements research during vegan pregnancy,"My girlfriend and I are expecting a baby in February. Once I found out we were pregnant one of the first things I did was spend a night researching which vitamins and nutrients are important to make sure she and the baby have enough of these.
Generally we eat very healthy, almost completely organic, but still it is hard to get things such as B12 or Omega Acids from plants only, so wanted to be on the safe side and supplement to the daily minimum dose.
Below is a list of what my midnight hours on the internet returned in condensed form. 
In short my GF and our baby are doing great, and the doctor that is accompanying us during the pregnancy has stated that everything important is covered. Many people told me I should post this information somewhere so here it is.
If it is of interest I can link two three shops in Germany where vegan supplements are available, for example vegan Omega 3 capsules which was tough to find. (We tried oils first but didn't like the aftertaste) Just let me know...  (I have no affiliation with any shops whatsoever and am in no way being paid or receiving discounts etc. for this.)

Thought it might help others get started. I am NOT a health professional so please confirm this with your doctor and consider this basic information to start with only.


Phatty Acids
-  Omega 3 Acids from EPA and DHA saturated oils or capsules (200 mgDHA/day, essential for mother and child) 

Vitamins
- Vitamin B12 (10-50 ug per day)
- Vitamin B6 
- Vitamin B2 
- Folic acid (400 ug per day, ideally also before pregnancy)
- Vitamin A
- Vitamin C
- Vitamin D3 (20 ug/800ie per day) 

Minerals
- Iron
- Iodine (100-150 ug per day)
- Zink
- Magnesium
- Calcium

We've been taking Chlorella Tablets (B Vitamins) and and Marine Calcium tablets as they include a lot of trace minerals on top. 

The source of the recommended minimum doses etc. was the German PETA site which was a great starting point for us: https://www.peta.de/gesundemama

I‚Äôm slipping,"Hi y‚Äôall, just here for some encouragement.  I started eating Vegan around June of this year, and as of recently, I‚Äôve been staring at all the food I used to love and just feeling empty inside.  Not like spiritually empty, but physically empty.  I noticed when I first started eating Vegan, I would feel full, but never satiated.  This leads me to eat all day long, but I never feel ‚Äúfull‚Äù even though my stomach feels full. This, mixed with some cravings has caused me to break on just a couple occasions and eat cheese.  Since I‚Äôve gone vegan, these are the things I‚Äôve had that have animal products.  

Two bites of Pizza Hut cheesy crust in October. 

A sliver of smoked salmon in November

Mashed potatoes with butter in them at Thanksgiving.

A full babybel cheese (this is my most egregious, because I thought about eating for a full hour before hand and I was in a very low place.  

A slice of cake at a party.  

And most recently, a slice of cheese pizza with all the cheese peeled off.  


I feel bad, I really do, but my plan is to go 100% in the new year.  I feel like I‚Äôve cut myself too much slack, and each time (except for the babybel) my mishap was brought on by social pressure.  I‚Äôm familiar with the term Freegan, and part of me wonders if that‚Äôs a better choice for me, but I‚Äôm also sort of an all or nothing person, and the thought of hurting a sweet cow any more than I have in my life hurts me.  I guess partially, I needed to get this off my chest, but if anyone has been through something similar to what I‚Äôm going through in the transition period, I would love to hear your stories.  And if anyone has any new and unique foods that fill voids left behind by animal products, I‚Äôm all ears.

Waking Up: Life on a Small 'Humane' Farm,"*You cannot carry passengers on a smallholding. This is what I had been told. I didn't like it but I believed it to be true. Everything has to earn its keep.* 

*Be strong.* 

*Onion had his head chopped off... we ate him*

&amp;#x200B;

Vicky Hamill's childhood love of animals inspired her move to a smallholding in the wilds of Orkney. Initially she had some chickens and a goat but, unable to refuse any animal that needed her help, she quickly found herself tending a motley collection of sheep, cows, goats and geese on her small 'humane' farm.

But farm animals have a defined life cycle. In this memoir, Vicky recounts the conflict between her attachment to her animals and the demands of farming. She vividly recalls the joys of feeding newborn lambs and the despair of killing them, joyous and heartbreaking moments that eventually led her to quit the farm and become a vegan.

Exquisitely narrated and deeply moving, this is a book for anyone who questions the morality of the food on their plate. It doesn't preach but it convincingly tells the story of one woman's journey towards awareness.

The poor baby had passed on, and he was pretty bloody... and really, it just made me think about so much. Mostly about the cruelty I've consumed in my life.

Vegan January anyone?,"For the past year I‚Äôve enjoyed eating meat less and less, it‚Äôs been a feeling more than anything. I had tried a vegetarian diet for a couple of months a few years back and felt better, but have never tried a fully vegan diet!

I I‚Äôve just been lazy switching to vegan as cooking vegan food has (maybe incorrectly) seemed more difficult, and finding options at restaurants seems more difficult. 

I watched  [The Game Changers on Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/watch/81157840) yesterday which was super interesting, it talks about the benefits athletes have seen when going vegan. And it‚Äôs produced by Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jackie Chan, Arnie has got to know what he‚Äôs talking about üòÇ

It also talks about the inflammatory effects of animal foods, so I‚Äôm keen to see if a vegan diet could help with some knee and shoulder issues I‚Äôve been having.  

The doc mentions how 3 weeks is how long it takes to see some effects, so I (and my girlfriend and a friend) figured Jan 2020 would be a good month to try go fully vegan and see how we feel. 

Plus, if I do en up going fully vegan now it will be an easy date to remember when I tell my grandkids about it in 50 years ü§ì

Any Vegan Crocheters/Knitters? I have some questions.,"I have been crocheting for almost 17 years. I typically use acrylic yarn, which is vegan, but I don't like the texture. I find acrylic to be inconsistent as far as texture goes, especially since my previous yarn purchases have been Red Heart and the like because money. The best yarn I have ever used was alpaca (not purchased by me, and used before I went vegan), but obviously that is out of the question.

I'm interested in making items that feel more high-end without necessarily being insanely expensive. I'm basically looking to hone my craft more and make better-quality things that are cruelty-free. Sustainability is also a big deal, and acrylic doesn't really check that box. I haven't worked with a ton of different types of fiber because of cost issues. 

So here's my question: what materials do you guys use? I've heard bamboo yarn and hemp yarn are more sustainable, but how are they on cost and texture? Also, where do you get your yarn? I don't think my local craft stores will have that kind of thing so I'm curious as to where I can find more sustainable vegan yarn. I'm willing to pay a little more now that I'm older and have a better-paying job, so I really want to explore my options.

How would you guys handle a catered event?,"Howdy friends. I'm a 5 year vegan in a very conservative area. If you dont hunt or love steak in this town, you're just not right. The only options I have when going out to eat is either chipotle or taco bell, which is fine, I've had no problem thriving from the things I can get from the grocery store. 

If all goes as planned I will be graduating next semester and am starting an internship at a firm the end of next month, which is a huge opportunity for me since there isn't a lot of options in the area to get experience. I really want this internship to lead to a job offer but it is well known that there are 10 other people to replace me if need be. 

I was invited to their holiday party which is catered. When I RSVP'd I needed to let them know if I wanted chicken or steak. Trying my best to not have my entire identity right off the back be the vegan I just replied that my wife and I dont eat meat so we'd be happy to partake in the festivities while skipping dinner. 

A couple of days later hr emailed me stating they will be providing a pasta dish for us. I thanked them so much for their accommodations.

How far are you willing to go to be ethical?,"When I think of veganism I think of a person who goes above and beyond to be ethical, eco friendly  and conscious of ALL suffering including people. I also think beyond diet, I think of an entire lifestyle, I believe diet means nothing if you ignore everything else.

 While I understand this is different from person to person, I'm curious as to how far some people are willing to go to be ethical. Some of the things I'm curious about are: do you stick to strictly vegan stores and companies so you arent supporting companies that also produce non-vegan food (for example Coca-Cola owns Fairlife, would this mean you avoid anything owned by Coca-Cola even if the ingredients are vegan, or shop at Walmart because you're still supporting their business to sell non-vegan goods)? Do you avoid foods that have a horrible impact on the environment like palm oil (deforestation of the amazon rainforest and killing of orangutans, I've noticed a lot of vegan food contains palm oil), almonds, soy, etc.? Are you conscious of child and slave labour, as in, do you consume coffee and cocoa that isnt fair trade or buy things made in countries like china, Bangladesh, vietnam etc.? How do you get around? Car, bus, bike? Do you use plastic, including vegan leather, or do you go for plant fiber and other natural biodegradable fibre (plastic of any kind harms the planet which harms animals, for many many years)

Tomorrow is my 10 Year Veganniversary,"As the title suggests, tomorrow is my 10 year Veganniversary and I thought I'd celebrate with a few tips for anyone making the transition in a few years. 

1. Eat enough calories. Incorporate plenty of potatoes, grains/pasta/bread, beans, and nuts/seeds into your diet. If you are concerned about nutrients, it's easy to create a free account at [chronometer.com](https://chronometer.com) to track your nutrition. 
2. Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. You will never be able to reduce the amount of suffering caused by your consumption to zero. It's not a fun fact, but it is the truth. Make general rules and stick to them. Don't fret over every little minute additive in foods. 
3. Master one meal recipe at a time and have a few go-to meals at home.
4. TAKE A FUCKING  VITAMIN B12 SUPPLEMENT!  
5. Treat yo self occasionally. Becoming a vegan doesn't mean you're becoming a monk. (Unless you're literally becoming one of those Vietnamese vegan monks or something........) 
6. Don't let veganism become your entire identity. There are other important things in the world to fight for, strive towards, and create meaning in your life. Veganism doesn't solve every problem in life as some might have you believe.  Also, for some reason many vegans forget that humans are animals too and deserve to be free from exploitation, suffering, and abuse. 
7. If you're having trouble finding a vegan partner in your local community, the internet is your best friend. Use it. 
8. If you find yourself struggling or thinking about reverting, revisit the original reasons you went vegan in the first place. Re-watch a vegan documentary and get re-inspired somehow. 
9. It can be socially difficult to be a vegan. Anyone who tells you differently is not being honest. Try to develop the perspective that any struggles you have are sacrifices made on behalf of the animals/humans who would otherwise be harmed by your actions. 
10. If you are having health problems, see a physician. Veganism is not a cure-all. It can help prevent and treat many conditions but not everything.

Opinion: Following a vegan diet is different than being a vegan,"I think most of us can agree the less animal products we consume the more we are making a difference. Following a vegan diet and purchasing a leather handbag is better than purchasing that bag while following omni diet. But... you‚Äôre still making a conscious decision to hurt an animal when you were 100% able to avoid doing so. That is not vegan, and if you do this, you are not vegan. I wish there was a bigger distinction between a vegan lifestyle and a vegan diet. I hear plant-based being used more and I think that‚Äôs great, but too many people are still confusing a plant-based diet with veganism or using them interchangeably. You don‚Äôt go vegan for your health or because you want to lose weight, you do it for the animals. 

I want to make it clear that I‚Äôm not trying to discourage or alienate anyone who doesn‚Äôt fit my definition of vegan. The animals would be so grateful to know you are leaving them off your plate and I hope you continue your journey. However, hearing things such as,  ‚Äúmy friend‚Äôs vegan but she does it for the health benefits,‚Äù and  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm vegan but I allow myself to cheat,‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm mostly vegan,‚Äù etc. makes my blood boil because not only do these people not understand the difference between vegan and plant-based, but they are also spreading their misinformation.

Motorcycle boots I've found a couple, but it's been hit or miss, and I really want something that is slightly more armoured than your typical hiking boot.

Transition to Vegan: not getting morning wood?,"I'd like to mention the following information of myself so you have a better understanding.

I'm a 28 years old male health/fitness freak. I'm extremely conscious with what I eat, I buy almost everything organic. The only thing I haven't been consuming for the past 10 years is cow milk but I do consume grass fed whey protein after my workouts. I work out 5-6 times a day with medium to heavy weights and good amount of cardio.  I take a lot of multivitamins and other natural vitamins.

Here's where everything changed:

When I saw the Netflix documentary called ""Game Changers"" it influenced me to stop eating meat. I told myself that I'll start cutting red meat ( I mostly eat organic elk, horse and bison) and stay with seafood and poultry. Now, it could be psychological but it's been a few weeks now that my sex drive has decreased. I'm not sure if it's because I cut the red meat. At the same time I tried NoFap to see how things would change but then I end up worry so I try to see if my stick ""still works"" by fapping but it doesn't feel as firm nor does it stay for long.

My diet changed drastically.. I rarely eat any animal meat, instead its mostly lentils, beans, a lot of complex carbohydrates. I feel like I lost strength and body mass because some of my clothes feel loose. I mostly got worried because I wake up with no morning wood!

Does anyone have any experience like this or suggestions? thanks",vegan,eltrupin10,1577834425,20,True,2019-12-31

Happy one year Veganniversary to me! I want to talk about the smaller perks &lt;3,"I won't echo the importance of saving lives and fighting climate control in this post. After one year of Veganism, I want to talk about the other perks. 

1.) No more food coma for me. I thought having food coma was normal. Now I do not have any bloating problems and it is lovely.

2.)Better skin! I don't break out as much I did before.

3.) Dishes are easier to wash. Turns out getting animal products from pans were super hard. 

4.) Watching my nutrient. I mostly do this for other people when they ask where I get my protein (1st question I get when people find out I am Vegan). I tell them dark leafy green and legumes. They are normally skeptical until I flash them a screenshot of my cronometer. 

5.) My cooking improved and I am trying new, various ingredients. Previously, I would just stick with typical animal product with some veggies and rice/pasta. Now I have played around with different ingredients that I never even would have tried. I am discovering more and more foods that are so delicious. My fridge is looking like a garden and my grocery bills overall went down in price. Tofu is much cheaper than typical packaged meats.

6.) [I also did my best to be close to zero-waste]( https://imgur.com/OU0Mrd8). I went from 3.5 Earths to .9 Earth. I have not used a single plastic bag from stores, brought my own containers/bottles everywhere, started composting, got solar panels, and etc. 

7.) I rarely got sick this year compare to before.

First vegan anniversary.,"I began eating a whole foods plant based diet exactly one year ago.        I hoped it would improve my health.     It‚Äôs been life changing.    Psoriasis fatigue joint pain and bone pain are all gone.   Its far more than I ever hoped for.     Not eating any thing from animals and causing suffering changes the way I think.

My friends doesn't like veggies but got convinced that veganism (or at least vegetarianism) is the right step - how can I help?,"My best friend is a very rational and logical being. And while I usually am not trying to convince people to change their diet, with him it was an exception. It just bothered me how someone so critical in thinking can not see all that is wrong with eating meat, be it from an ethical, a health or environmental view point. 

So I tried and today sent him a video of EarthlingEd ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3u7hXpOm58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3u7hXpOm58)) and essentially his stance only 5min in became ""He is only saying things I agree with"" and that he is willing to give it a try but feels lost from a practicality point since he doesn't like veggies at all. So ""plant-based"" was just kind of scary in his mind so far.

I told him to watch the rest and practicality won't be the thing that's making his endeavor fail. Now I wanted to ask you guys for ideas / help how to approach this and to get a sanity check on how I would continue:

1) I want to sit down with him and talk it through. Which scenarios is he facing that he views potential problems with? What foods does he actually like (I think he's okay with lettuce, spinach, beans, lentils, potatoes, tomato sauce, chickpeas and carrots, so there is stuff to work with).? How much is he willing to cook himself? What does he currently usually eat and how can we simply veganize that?   
(Side note: ofc it would be cool if he could change his stance on veggie consumption and all that, but let's assume for the moment, this is not going to happen and too many changes at once won't be easier to handle, so let's work within that framework for now, ok?)

2) Ideally I'd like to recommend one of those 30 day programmes that cover step by step different things and make it less scary. Does anyone have good recommendations for that? I've done the one from PETA 2 and I saw the link on this sub to the vegan bootcamp. Any other recs?

3) He's not huge on cooking but for the dishes he does on a regular basis, I can walk him through veganize them since I am fairly good in all things kitchen related. 

Is there anything else you guys can think of that might help?

Also, this sounds like he is kind of lazy and doesn't do much thinking himself. That's not it. I'm pretty positive that it is just scary to realize how wrong your food choices are but you dislike most veggies. I'm really excited about helping him through this transition.

Vegan Omega 3 supplements-- price spreadsheet and Consumer Labs information,"Awhile back I did my research into Omega 3s and decided to supplement. Tired of the uncertainty, I finally paid Consumer Labs for a product report, and did some research on price, to try and find the best products out there.

When selecting a vegan omega-3 product, it is easy to find products high in ALA, but keep in mind ALA is not as useful to the body as DHA and EPA, and is converted rather inefficiently from ALA to those more useful forms (if I recall correctly, something like 1/5 to 1/3, but I did that research several months ago and have now forgotten.)

Here's my google spreadsheet on vegan Omega 3s, including price per pill, mg EPA/pill, mg DHA/pill, and total EPA+DHA/cent. 

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G8uG5lZ4JOFX_OPFyGSuJMuiFIZJ_SDeg7keozS42LM/edit?usp=sharing

It's not intended to be entirely comprehensive, but some products were obviously going to be more expensive for less content so I didn't bother adding them.

Let me know if you find better prices, or if the info is inaccurate. Also note the entire Consumer Labs Omega-3 report is linked in .PDF form. It's got a lot of info on things like medical applications for Omega-3s and dosing.

My findings: Ovega 3 is not only the best cost/pill and cost/amount of omegas, but also one of the brands that was tested on Consumer Labs and recommended. Deva came in second, and was also tested by Consumer Labs.

None of the others were tested.

Also note: NO algae-derived omega 3s are currently USP certified. USP is an international standardizing body that tests for accuracy of labeling, freedom from impurities, bioavailability, etc. 

Several are Good Manufacturing Process certified, which means they are likely to be consistent in terms of purity/availability/contamination/etc, but it's a lower standard than USP.",vegan,realvmouse,1577917710,14,True,2020-01-01

Is there a hypocrisy on being pro-life and refusing to go vegan?,"So I constantly debate with someone about veganism and it always leads to the same conclusion with her. She thinks that human life is above all else. Humans are superior and more intelligent and have higher levels of consciousness. End of discussion. She refuses to go vegan because she doesnt see anything wrong with eating animals.  
But she's against abortion, doesnt matter if its a cluster of cells, doesnt matter if they dont co. (She had a baby at 19 years old when she had no place to stay, with a boyfriend that she despises, and no financial stability, THAT'S how much against abortion she is) I am personally pro-choice and vegan of course. It's not that I dont value human life, but I believe people should have the choice with what to do with their body and if they want to bring a child in this world (especially with climate change and overpopulation). I dont believe killing in the womb is the same as killing a conscious child who doesn't want to die.

So I feel like there's an hypocrisy in there somewhere that I can't quite grasp. She think its wrong to kill a human doesnt matter if its a mass of cells or 8 month old fetus, while paying for others to torture and murder other living sentient beings, Maybe its that the fetus is not as conscious/sentient/intelligent as the animals that we kill? (pigs are just as intelligent as 3 year old kid). The fetus doesn't consent just like the animals we kill don't consent to death. Is that it? I feel like I'm missing something. Can someone help me solve this argument?",vegan,nickability,1577925031,30,True,2020-01-01
How much should I worry about B12 right now?,"I'm a 20 y/o dude who ate animals and animal products pretty much everyday before. Two months ago I decided to be a vegetarian because the idea of eating dead animals was disgusting me and wanted to make an impact on the planet. A few weeks later I realised vegetarianism is enough and started to cut or replace the most obvious and unnecessary animal products. I'm pretty much a vegan today, after 2 months.

But my issue is that I heard that supplementing B12 is essential for vegans and I haven't taken any yet. I've searched the internet and some sources say that B12 is stored for years and that we don't need to really worry after only a few months others say we need to take it ASAP. Some say that eating breakfast cereal and non dairy milk often and the occasional vegan junk food is enough, others say that we really need supplements. 

Could you help me here, please? There are people saying it's also a big meat eater issue and that they only lose their minds when it comes to vegans. Also, could you educate me a little more on omega 3? I occasionally eat tofu and nuts.",vegan,ultrarotom,1577925485,5,True,2020-01-01

I‚Äôm going meatless (vegan) on Mondays.,"What‚Äôs up Vegan community?

My name is Morgan, I‚Äôm a professional athlete in the sport of Greco-Roman Wrestling. An amateur physiologist, and professional strength and conditioning coach. 

I‚Äôm no Vegan per-se. But have had my life‚Äôs experiences with a plant based diet. Over two years while competing and training led to some interesting adaptations which may have been favorable in other context, ultimately didn‚Äôt lead to my peak performance. Because of this,  in combination with the caloric deficits affecting my body weight, I returned to my omnivorous ways and found homeostasis.

Currently, I call myself a stay at home Vegan. This is because my fianc√© is vegan and cooks most of the meals for us.  When eating eating anything of an animal product, I simply cook for myself. This extends out to the extra calories that I need in order to sustain my training load. (Upwards of 5,000 calories).

I decided to add some change to my diet in a new way.  So I decided to go completely vegan on Mondays.  I‚Äôm pretty stoked to go meatless on Monday‚Äôs. My fianc√©, who is a die hard vegan, has great health, fitness and athleticism . She‚Äôs a perfect exemplar of a vegan success story.; it‚Äôs very inspiring.  While I could never claim the tribe, the sentiments, physiological(health/fitness), political, and environmental considerations and conversations which are created are valuable for all of society to understand.  All the while also showing that people they can incorporate and change an element of their diet with success, so they do it without having to have an ‚Äúidentity change.‚Äù Importantly, collective small actions make big changes. 

I‚Äôll take notes and log about the marginal change in my Mondays and how it may make any changes to the overall picture of my performance, training, recovery and sleep. My Goal is to find the right balance in order to find which can help me improve my diet and performance the best.

So there you have it.

I'm having a hard time being consistently vegan.,"I decided to become vegan a year or so ago and remained consistent for only a couple of weeks. My parents understood and began to eat less meat and dairy themselves, but still told me that i should eat meat ocationally, and that being vegan was a type of extremism. They continued to put fish and cheese on my plate, and me, really loving these foods, ate them anyways. I have reduced the quantity of meat and dairy i consume almost to an 80%, and i have stopped eating cows meat completly. 

 I want to be completly vegan, since i totally agree on vegan principles, but the fact that i have a sort of cheese addiction, and my parents arent the most supportive (and yes i have had endless, well informed conversations with them, to the point where they agree with my points, just not my being a vegan), makes this really hard for me. I tried to make a new years resolution to stay vegan, but i broke it the first day, since my parents put some cheese out for breakfast and i just couldnt help eating some, and then a whole lot.

How to Lose Weight Faster," lose 5 pounds in a single week! It's a figure of speech we see all over the place. And keeping in mind that it's conceivable that somebody can lose that much (if not more) in that timespan, it truly relies upon your digestion and heaps of different elements, including physical action and body structure, which are all altogether remarkable to you.¬†

It's spreading!,"Sorry, I'm still new to this platform so I apologise for the potentially cancerous formatting!

I'm not even sure if this belongs here but I figured I'd post it anyway. 

I've been vegan for almost a year now and constantly catch flak about it from my co-workers. I'm not thin-skinned, but I'm just getting tired of the same boring old old jokes and the never-ending army of strawman arguments. 

Anyway, getting back on point! I have a client who must be in his 60s who has been coming to me for a few months. We'd chatted a lot while he's been in and out came up that I'm vegan. He showed an interest and asked a lot about what I eat ect. 

Fast forward to the appointment before last, he sits down in the chair and says:

Client: I'm actually looking for some information,and you're the man to talk to.

I was taken back because I didn't have a clue what he was referring to. It turned out that he and his wife had recently watched the documentary ""Game Changers"" and were in the middle of making their transition into veganism and were looking for places to eat in our city üòÅ

I, of course gave him my own full rundown based off a blog post I wrote months ago about vegan food in my city. I ended up writing down some of my favourite places on a card for him before he left that day. 

He came in again yesterday. Pleased to say he and his wife are making even more progress! He went out after his last appointment and went to one of the restaurants at the top of the list (top of the list was a place that did vegan and Omni dishes, cause their vegan food is banging but the place isn't too intimidating for people getting into it) but they were packed so they ended up going to the fully vegan place instead. 

On top of that he was also telling me about all the documentaries they've been watching including cowspiracy among others. 

He was even talking about how people have started treating him differently because of him going vegan (oddly refreshing to know it's not just me getting shit for itüòÇ).

what is the harm in using animal by-products?,"yeah, yeah, yeah throw at me the definition of veganism all you want, but what i'm after is results. Will actions decrease or increase animal suffering? using by-products can make veganism much easier to practice without causing harm to animals (refined sugar is actually not vegan is made from bone char, a by-product of meat industry), I have a co-worker who quit veganism because of all the by products that she couldn't use (refined sugar be the most difficult one. she was also an idiot who said something about veganism was hard because she even got off the bus early to walk so she could lose weight and that she was initially reluctant to quit veganism because she didn't want to break her five year record.)

I want to have discussion about the harm in using animal by products and which ones are ok to use in our current time. For example, i would think that leather wouldnt be okay to use because leather is still an expensive item due to its history and cultural symbol, such that i could see people raising cows just for leather to use for expensive shoes and bags. However, I can also see things like beeswax and gelatin ok to use because their current appeal is that they are cheaper than vegan alternatives, which means that if we use beeswax and gelatin (that are used as part of products instead of the sole ingredient) while abstaining from meat, eggs, and dairy, it would eventually become nonsensical for businesses to use these ingredients because they would no longer be more affordable than vegan alternatives. thoughts?",vegan,LetsEndSuffering,1575195179,15,True,2019-12-01

THE ULTIMATE TRUTH,"As the title indicates, I'm trying to find out the ultimate truth about which diet is best, but there are always some source I trust that contradicts other sources and I'm back where I started.

I want to believe that facts presented in movies, such as ""The Game Changers"" and ""What The Health"", are true. Yet on YouTube a source I trust Dr.Berg still suggests keto, or just specific products, for instance, eggs. And when I reply to my friends' Instagram story where he is eating salami pizza with a response ""Watch ""What The Health"" you might rethink your pizza life"". I get a response ""I'm immune to that vegetable propaganda"". 

There is so much information out there, I just don't know what to believe anymore. Sure, plant-based diet won't hurt you, but are these movies I've mentioned truly objective, or are they forcing you to believe that nothing that comes from animals will ever help you?

I know I'm posting this on Vegan, and responses might be biased. I'm just looking for some answers (The Ultimate Truth as I call it) so I can devote myself to diet I end up with figuring out. (Right now I'm a vegetarian, who does vegan-days, and some vegan meals in-between.

Also while we are at it... People, who call themselves Vegans - it's a lifestyle, right? Not a diet? Then you couldn't own leather shoes, jackets, etc. And those who call themselves vegans, but only eat plant-based are not in particular actual vegans?

"Despite such a progressive title the book, Soul of an Octopus by Sy Montgomery, doesn't encourage anybody to stop abusing and consuming animals.","I just finished Soul of an Octopus and while it was informative I was not impressed. Early in the book the author talks about eating sushi with her friends from the aqaurium and proudly announces they didnt order the octopus, but they have no issue eating other fish? That is where I fist became skeptical of the book.

Throughout the book she talks about how animals like Eels, sharks, lobsters, etc. feel pain, can sympathize, and have different moods, but she never condemns eating them, and later she quite blatantly defends aquariums' ""need"" to capture these animals in the wild and pull them out of thier natural environment and homes to show off to the public.  She even talks about getting a pet octopus, but only refrains because it would be hard on her husband. (Capturing thriving wild animals for your own amusement should be considered non-vegan right?) 

The books includes other things like forced mating of octopuses, death of captive animals caused by lack of planning but labeled ""unavoidable"", and the people in the book treated animals like paintings in a shitty muesuem to be traded and transported around in small containers (The book unapologetically describes an octopus being mailed in bag of water filled with its own excrament stuffed into an old tv box labeled ""RUSH"", but not labeled delicate or live animal).

"Question about Vegan ‚Äúimitation foods‚Äù like Vegan cheese, meat, milk, etc","Hey all! 

I‚Äôm a newbie to Veganism - currently transitioning from an omni diet. I‚Äôve probably got the same story as a lot of people as far as the transition goes - shame about my willful ignorance regarding factory farming, guilt about my environmental footprint as an omni, etc. 

Anyways, I‚Äôm happy to be making the transition now! I have a question that‚Äôs been weighing on me, though, and I‚Äôm hoping to ask it without coming across as offensive or ignorant, as that‚Äôs not my intent at all. Please forgive me for any mis-steps here! 

I‚Äôm curious about the environmental footprint of the Vegan ‚Äúimitation‚Äù foods on the market that are created to mimic dairy and meat. I must admit that I‚Äôm loving the beyond burgers, but they‚Äôre super over-packaged and I find that quite disappointing. That‚Äôs caused me to also consider all of the production and processing that goes into creating these imitation products, as well. The products themselves can be really good - but with all of the packaging and processing, what is their environmental impact? 

I‚Äôve seen a lot of conversation on the topic of the environmental cost of the meat and dairy industries, but does anyone know how the Vegan imitation food industry compares? 

Again, I mean no offence, so I‚Äôm very sorry if this comes across as offensive. I‚Äôm just curious about how I can move forward with my Vegan diet in a conscious and informed way - and with these industries growing so quickly, I do find some cause for concern.

2. Other plants like mushroom, ginger, onions, carrots, tomatoes, etc, would make (**30%**) of my main meal diet;
3. I also trim down refined carbs or carb with high Glycemic index in my main meal diet like rice and noodles, I will make these starch-based food (10%) in my main meal diet;
4. I love eating seafood and eggs (4-5 per day) so they would be (15%) in my main meal diet;
5. My family eats meat, but they believe similar theory I believe -- eat far more plants than meat, therefore the (5%) will be terrestrial animal meat in my main meal diet;
6. I don't like eating beans or Tofu, I know it's weird since I am Asian. I also dislike them and nuts because they are a hassle to deal with, they need to be processed to remove all the enzymes, oxalic acid, phytic acids or tannins. So they cannot be a part of my main meal diet.

I don't really eat much animal sourced products outside of my main meal,

I love eating fruits and avocado for after meal desserts:

I take some supplements:

Astaxanthin from Haematococcus pluvialis

Krill oil;

"(TW talk about killing animals, basically) Opinions on eating hunted meat?","Hello! First time posting on r/vegan, and I'm not trying to cause any drama or controversy, rather have a friendly discussion about this. 

I would like to know what you people think of hunted meat (elk, deer) and fish (I kinda get this one bcs it's kind of disgusting to cause them to basically suffocate, unless you immediately get them out of the misery [bash their head, basically]) and eggs from self raised chicken, who I know had a good life in my back yard.

I personally hate the thought of farming animals for meat, the way they are treated is disgusting, but when it comes to hunting, I don't see it see it as bad since it is sort of the circle of life. In my personal opinion shooting and immediately killing a deer is much different from a wolf killing a deer for sustenance. Of course, I know people don't nessecary need the meat to survive, but we kind of anyways need to keep the animal population in control (maybe someone could elaborate if this is indeed he case, I'm assuming it is for the sake of the animals not getting in the way of humans, causing less car accidents and making sure they don't spread too near our living areas, causing more trouble for both humans and the animals) (also I don't believe in hunting for fun, like foxes and other animals might be), so why not utilize the meat. I know some vegans just find eating meat disgusting because is comes from another living being, but I kind of believe in the circle of life, if it's done in a way out of necessity. Fish is of course a little different since there isn't much nessecity for fishing, I'm assuming. I'm kind of on the edge about eating fish, maybe someone might be able to tip me either way?

About the free range chicken that YOU raised, I also believe in the fairness of eating their eggs, for I know they are treated well, and you might not have room to raise more chicken, so you anyways might have to disregard the eggs, again why not utilize it?

Again, this is all friendly discussion, I know this can easily get heated, so I just want your personal opinion, no judgement either way. 

Just to say, I'm also talking about elk for instance coming from a creditable source, like for instance I get mine from my father, who I know hunts for the nessecity of hunting, and provides the meat self butchered. Also I only eat it maybe once a month (or less), so it's a rare treat, in a way.",vegan,fitnesstuff,1575284560,2,True,2019-12-02

Feeling less and less like I want to be a vegan,"I've been vegan for almost 4 years. I went straight from typical meat diet to vegan. In that time I've noticed my moods are less stable than they used to be. My weight has skyrocketed and become harder to control. When I try to eat healthily it's a chore, I'm always hungry. Pre-vegan I lost weight very easily when I wanted to. I think I take in too many carbs and not enough protein.

I don't want to eat meat. I really, really don't. I was always more of an environmental than ethical vegan. But eggs and dairy aren't looking so bad to me right now. From an animal abuse standpoint of course they are, and I feel like a hypocrite. I don't want to go through the torment from my meat eating and vegan friends alike. It's embarrassing.

Visited my mother today and saw animals being mistreated,"Hi,

Today I visited my mother who's house is in an area with a lot of farmers that keep animals like cows, goats, sheep etc. While for the majority of the year when it's warm they're all outside, today I saw the conditions that some of the cows live in for months on end during the winter time of the year. I know not all of these farmers treat the animals they have this way, but to see how someone could treat these cows this way absolutely crushed me inside. I've seen it before in documentaries, and I've seen it before when I was younger. But how can someone think to themselves that treating another living being this way! The cows might not be beat or harmed physically, but the way that the are bound inside in FILTHY living conditions set to stand or cramply lie down in their own bowel movements. These animals shouldn't be treated this way. They shouldn't be bound inside in a awfully cramped space, with no way to move, dark, cold and dirty for months on end without any relief. They shouldn't be bound up like that for any period of time. I don't eat meat myself, but if we're going to accept eating meat as a society, we cannot allow for the animals that ultimately end up on someone's plate to live these kinds of lives. It hurts me deeply, to see another living creature being forced to suffer like that. It would be akin to putting someone constrained to their bed for months while they defecate and filthy themselves. 

Whoever takes ""care"" of these cows cannot have a conscience or see animals as anything other than objects to be used and discarded. It makes me sad, it makes me angry how doing this to animals is allowed by the law. I can think of a million ways to improve the living conditions of these cows! Although I personally object to keeping animals in any form for the purpose of using them in any form as a product, it saddens me that the laws that are supposed to protect the animal as an individual has no effect what so ever. It might not be economically sustainable for these farmers to invest in ways to ensure the animals are to every capacity able to live comfortable, healthy and enriching lives, but that doesn't excuse treating animals this way. If it's not economically sustainable for you to care for the animals under your house, then you shouldn't have taken on the responsibility in the first place. 

With all our riches, with all our resources we ought to make sure the animals that live under our care are actually taken care of! And I don't think there's any farmer in my country or any country that doesn't mistreat the animals under their care :/",vegan,poofyogpoof,1575306676,4,True,2019-12-02

"Interested in Veganism, but there are a lot of personal monetary and mental obstacles.","Hello! So for my whole life I‚Äôve eaten meat. I never really thought about it, since it‚Äôs the norm, and for the longest time I just laughed off veganism and vegetarianism, thinking that would never be me. The thing is though, I think about it a lot, how it doesn‚Äôt make sense to love cows but then turn around and eat cows. And drink milk made for cows. And just eating meat in general, knowing that pigs are intelligent and chickens are fluffy and turkeys love cuddle piles. So I would like some advice. I LOVE steak and roast a lot. And I like cow milk the best. I have tried several other milk alternatives but they were all too thick, and they tasted too gross and nutty and dirt-like to me, whereas cow milk is sweet to me. It does help that I‚Äôm starting to become extremely lactose intolerant. I‚Äôm sure one day I‚Äôll find a good alternative, but how do I get past my love for steak? It seems impossible. Not to mention the fact that I‚Äôm very picky and lazy. I think the most ideal stuff would be cheap, easy to make meals. And hopefully some sweet treats, maybe vegan cake? I would love that. And if I heard correctly eating this way can help mental illness, but correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. Overall, I think it would be very beneficial for me.

Might I offer some insight from a newbie?,"I‚Äôm hesitant to post this since I‚Äôm VERY new to the vegan lifestyle, so let me preface this by saying I know I‚Äôm a rookie and I am not trying to offer any advice at all, but rather some insight to someone who is long past their ‚Äúconversion moment.‚Äù

About six weeks ago, the documentary ‚ÄúThe Game Changers‚Äù was recommended to me and I watched it. As a lifelong animal product consumer, I was immediately impacted by this film and have been cold turkey vegan ever since watching it. 

One of the biggest things I most appreciated about that film was it had barely anything to say about the animal rights side of things. It thoroughly convinced me purely from a health aspect. Everyone I have recommended it to has been impacted from it and almost every single one could care less about the animal rights argument to convert to plant products. Now since then, I have done a lot more research and my eyes have been opened to the major issues in the animal industries. I continue to research more and have growing convictions around topics of which I never gave a fleeting thought. 

So my point; trying to make a case about plant-based and vegan lifestyles from an animal rights point of view is not going to win the crowd en masse. 

Humans have a natural propensity to think ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs in it for me?‚Äù If you can show them their personal benefit and how their bodies will be better for it before exposing them to the horrors of force fed geese, you‚Äôre going to win a lot more fans to the cause.

Looking for Research,"Hi all,

To start, I'm not currently a vegan. One of my best friends throughout my life has always been one so I've always been around it. I've been thinking about moving towards it lately and am looking for some research on it.

I'm mostly curious about protein/calorie levels in vegan diets, as well as hormonal changes with high levels of soy intake or even just vegetable intake. I know these are some pretty highly debated topics, so tell me whatever you know about them, but I am mostly just looking for the research so I can read it over myself. I'm also really physically active, doing weightlifting, trail-running, and martial arts, so anything about that would be cool.

I have a background in biochemistry, I'm close to finishing my degree in it, so I've got a decent amount of background knowledge surrounding it, so I feel confident I can understand most of the research that would be presented on it.

If it means anything to you, the Netflix documentary ""The Game Changers"" made me want to look into this a little  bit more, it showed a lot of research, but I wanted to look it over myself, and figured I'd just ask you guys for more specific stuff.

"Want to go vegan, but some questions are holding me back","Hello everyone! 

I am in the process off going plant based and potentially vegan (I'm currently researching the ethical parts of killing or exploiting animals, thus this post). I have done some research but I haven't been able to find answers to some of my questions. I am probably misinformed about several things in what I am about to write. Feel free to point out any error!

1. If I am sick but not in a way which threatens my life (let's say I have a cold with a runny nose and a decently high fever), is it ethically ok for me to take drugs to ease my symptoms? Let's assume the medicine is made in a lab without animal products, but it is the result of animal testing. By buying the medicine I am giving the company money which they use on new RnD projects which means more animal testing. I am thus funding and incentivicing the killing of animals simply to ease my non-lethal symptoms, i.e for comfort. Am I missing something here or do vegans not use medications except in life threatening situations?
2. When it comes to animal testing for medicine in general, I am conflicted. The reason being that the medicine resulting from the animal testing saves human lives, and there is no alternative (is there?) to doing the animal tests. Given the choice between saving a human and saving a non-human animal I'd obviously save the human and I feel like the animal testing is a similar dilemma. Obviously it's not as clear cut as the choice I presented since you can't know which animal tests are going to yield a break-through and which will be essentially wasted. 

Thank you for reading my post. If you have some thoughts or knowledge about the things I have written, please comment! These are the only questions that I am currently aware of which are holding me back from going full vegan.",vegan,BB_Boyo,1575367808,19,True,2019-12-03

Planning Christmas with the family - a conflicted thing,"Hi all, as the title suggests, I'm currently rather conflicted with regards to Christmas plans, so maybe you can give me some pointers and opinions - I feel kinda lost with this situation as I haven't had to deal with this before.

Quick outline: everyone except for my girlfriend and me is omni. When I ditched meat, I was told that it's okay (gee, thanks a bunch!) but I couldn't expect them to conform with my diet. Also, traditionally, Christmas dinner at home was meat fondue (aka a pot of soup on the table and everyone cooks bits of meat over the course of 2-3 hours).

Now, I'm living \~8 hours travel from my family, so I see them maybe once a year, which is why my mother was devastated when I told here we wouldn't be coming because ""joining in on the fondue is rather pointless"" (and disturbing, as I see it now). Also, as stated before, I was told beforehand that they wouldn't conform my wishes, which is why I didn't think of suggesting an alternative. However, after convincing my mom it's not just some excuse but an actual problem for me, she herself suggested we have an alternative. I was quite happy about this and told her my girlfriend and me could prepare a nice (vegan) dinner for the evening. 

All seemed well to me until I phoned my sister today, who responded to this change of plans with ""Ok so we can prepare one vegan dish and one with meat"". Now, I don't really see why we would need to go through the trouble of preparing two dishes if everyone could just as well eat the vegan dish. And, to be honest, us two vegans only decided to join the Christmas dinner with the prospect of having a meat-free evening. After some ""why can't everybody have what they want"", ""why is this a problem for you"", ""you vegans are so complicated"", ""so typical, all plans have to be made according to you vegans"" etc. the call ended (badly).

Am I overreacting to this ""make two dishes"" thing? How do you handle others insisting on meat? 

I'm not sure whether Christmas with the whole family will happen now - as it stands, either me or my sister will not join, in which case I would feel bad for my mom.

12,000 people died during the swine flu epidemic, and 1/5th of Americans got the disease (60 million Americans). During April 2009, the Obama administration changed the name of swine flu to H1N1 in order to protect animal agriculture industry.

"The word ""Vegan"" does not do justice to our cause.","I have always felt like the word ""vegan"" does not do justice to our cause.

Veganism primarily focuses on the alleviation of animal suffering but the word stem ""veg"" seems to get omnis thinking that what vegans really like is their veggies. It gets lumped into the same category as vegetarian.

Veganism is not a diet. It is an ethical position.

As someone who is on day 4 of the vegan journey and was an omni, I believe that this was what made it hard to take veganism seriously at the start. When I reconnected it to the animal suffering aspect, I instantly had a change of heart.

Perhaps veganism would have been more convincing to omnis at face value had it been termed something like ""compassionism"" or whatever smart thing someone can come up with. Ideally, the word should have been about a human value like peace/non-violence instead of the word ""veg""?

I also constantly feel stomach pains and just the feeling like I have to poop, but can't poop when I go to the toilet.

Fuck me for wanting to be nice for the animals,"My dad told me that me not eating meat is like me thinking that I'm better than God because he put the animals here for us to eat and I won't eat them. I then said that I don't eat animals because it isn't needed anymore. He said that it is needed. I said that we have plenty of plant based foods to eat that can provide us with a balanced diet. He said that pleasure in food is important. I said that I find pleasure in the food that I eat. He then made the ""but bacon"" argument and said that God wouldn't give us bacon just to take it away for us.

I dropped the subject as it wasn't going anywhere. He then asked me if I was going to do the dishes. I told him I'd do them if the food we ate didn't contain meat. He called that BS and said that I should move out. I told him that I am moving out in a month and he made a comment that he didn't mean about me moving out immediately.

I love my father. He's not a bad guy and I don't want to paint him as such. He's an extremely hard worker and has always done all that he can to provide for our family. It's just hard when we both feel very strongly about opposite views on something. This is so important to me. I'm a new vegetarian who aspires to be vegan and literally have zero support and hear ridicule every single day. I'm worried that I'm going to crack under the pressure. I wish that I didn't need to eat food. My life would be so much easier that way.

"10 day vegan - Energy, and a new lease on life!","I consider myself a very critical person, and I never take wild claims seriously. ""It would give you energy, it will help you loose weight, it will clear your skin, it will lift your mood, etc."" Most of those claims associated with veganism I considered to either be hype, outright bull, or something that wouldn't work for me.

I decided to start a whole food plant diet, simply because the evidence has been accumulating for so long, that it prolongs longevity and better health outcomes, that I couldn't continue to ignore it.   
Also because despite the fact I  strictly ate what is considered a healthy diet, and I was not healthy. I have Ulcerative Colitis and in the last year I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis. I'm 29 y.o. I have an amazing team of doctors, and the latest drug treatment I'm on is really good, and is helping me tremendously, but despite that my outlook on the future is grim. How long will the biologic medication stop working for me, just like all the previous meds had. Before I need surgery, or I become disabled, or I develop another chronic condition?

Only two days on the whole food plant diet I was feeling energetic. You don't know how much that means to me. People like me with chronic illness have a term to describe the struggle of low energy - [The Spoon Theory](https://butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/) &lt; I suggest everyone who doesn't know about it to read the link, and then go and hug the spoonies in their life.  
I would feel drained every day, have to skip on seeing family and friends to rest. Balance the pros and cons of going grocery shopping when I would be too tired when I come back to cook, and so much more. Your whole mindset changes, and the people around you get used to you saying no to them constantly, and eventually stop inviting you.

Only two days on the whole food plant based diet, and I felt better than I ever had before. I was so stupidly happy I ran up and down the stairs each chance I got. This influx of energy has not abated, I now exercises 15-20 minutes every day, simply because I have too much energy, something that would previously would've left me incapacitated for the day, or following day. The thought of doing it daily, would've been unthinkable. I'm waking up rested, and energized! It's amazing!

I hope this becomes my new normal, but I also don't want to ever forget, what a gift it is, to have the capacity to do the things I want in a day, and not be utterly drained all the time. 

Does anyone know - why? Why do vegans experience this jump in energy? I was not able to found a lot on the subject online, and its not talked about much, only mentioned. For me it's huge, and has given me a chance for a future, I didn't think I still had.",vegan,ivo_sotirov,1572593469,6,True,2019-11-01

Six years ago, I had my favourite meat - a medium done steak of salmon. After the meal, I just spent the night in thought of ""what's the point?"" I knew the environmental harm, I had spent years ignoring the welfare issues I couldn't reconcile with and I had had enough. I was fucking done. I'm almost at my year point of veganism. I stopped buying cows milk for home about two years ago, I had already been using only vegan toiletries and cosmetics for years. I was sitting in my backyard, thinking about the contents of my fridge and pantry. All that stood between me and actioning my values was one serving of cheese. Like giving up meat, I was fucking done. I felt like a hypocrite. I regret my years spent as a vegetarian, doing as much harm to the planet and animals as omnis. But I don't regret the initial decision to stop eating meat and I don't regret the decision to stop all animal products. I have never felt more aligned with who I am than I have these last eleven months of veganism and am so ready for the rest to come.

You can request eggless vaccines which i strongly recommend you do: 

Here's the article: https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/889563
Soft pay wall, so I'll quote: 

&gt; [Researches]  recommend ditching egg-based vaccine propagation in favor of cell culture or the recombinant DNA baculovirus system.

&gt; ""Dr Paules and colleagues note that confirmed influenza cases in Australia reached 215,280 by mid-October, which is dramatically higher than the 59,000 cases reported during the 2009 pandemic""

&gt; ""A factor for low efficacy is that most influenza-vaccine viruses are propagated in eggs, and the vaccine virus changes during egg-based production in ways that facilitate replication in eggs but reduce vaccine effectiveness against circulating virus.""

&gt; ""A key change appears to be a mutation in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein that mediates receptor binding by neutralizing antibodies, according to a recent study from researchers at the Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.  The researchers identified an HA glucosylation site that was lost during egg adaptation but remained in circulating influenza A (H3N2) strains.""

How do you handle being vegan considering the amount of non-dietary products that come from animals?,"Hi,

I recently had a discussion with a friend about veganism. Neither of us is vegan but I was taking a defensive stance because I believe that regardless of if you are vegan for animal cruelty or some other reason, I recognize that cattle has a huge impact on the environment in terms of emissions. 

His point was that there's no 100% vegan, and/or that it's illogical to call yourself vegan. The reason for this is because so many of the products in our society come from animals, so in the end you're still contributing to the killing/mistreatment of animals. He showed me [this image](http://huntergatherer.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/500/no_such_thing_as_a_vegan.jpg). Now I haven't fact checked all of them and he did say that a few of those are not true anymore (e.g. instrument strings which are mostly made of steel now) but I did check pills and according to my research most capsules are indeed made from animal product. 

How do you guys fit this into your philosophy, into your veganism? I do wish to understand.",vegan,IsPepsiOkaySir,1572618693,17,True,2019-11-01

Finally made the switch,"I did it guys, I finally transitioned to a vegan diet.

Awhile ago I posted here about my struggles transitioning. I had severe food intolerances to main staples like beans, legumes, gluten, and just about any grain. Each attempt was met with pain, blood, and a renewed frustration. You all had some suggestions, but in the end I felt like nothing would work and I was stuck eating this way forever.

Fast forward two years later. Went through one of the hardest times of my life. I was financially in the hole and I had to cut out meat to save money. I didn‚Äôt need it to survive, I knew that. I was vegetarian at this point and I felt alright. I started slowly introducing the foods that made me sick before, a little at a time. They still affected me, but not as much. Even though I had a negative reaction I kept at it. A little bit at a time I felt my gut biome adjusting and being able to digest everything. Oh my god, is it finally happening?

It‚Äôs been about 3 months on a vegan diet and I feel great. My workouts at the gym have improved, I don‚Äôt hit walls as often, and I recover quicker. I also have so much energy that I have a hard time falling asleep at night if I don‚Äôt work out or do something physically strenuous that day. I fart all the time it seems, but according to the internet that‚Äôs normal and it‚Äôs better than being in pain or bleeding. I‚Äôve been educating myself through books and documentaries and learned so much more than just the health benefits.

Considering going vegan at 17.,"Hello, nice to meet all of you! My name is Zacharie, and I‚Äôm considering going vegan at 17. I‚Äôm a home schooled student for my senior year, and I‚Äôm going back to public school SOON, meanwhile starting a job to be able to afford this diet. 

WHY am I considering? Well, one of the main factors is of course because I favor animals, and as good as the food tastes, vegan foods can taste just the same without any harm done to an animal, or companies that harm animals will not have my support. Another reason is my weight, I‚Äôve struggled with self image since I was 12-13 and want to turn this around before the possibility of an eating disorder. What way can I do that while making sure I stick to a diet if it means enjoying the same foods? by going vegan.

If I argued with myself from my freshman year, I‚Äôd have laughed and made a selfish edgy joke about veganism. I‚Äôd of made fun of vegans, and make stupid jokes about how meat is good. I‚Äôve grown since then, and have considered many diets and still feel that vegan is the way to go. Only problem is, expenses, somewhat weak immune system, etc.

I want to make sure this goes as smoothly as possible, and make sure this can follow me into college this next year. I will take ANY advice, or links to cheap items to get for dinners, lunches, etc. I use target and walmart the most for groceries, so if there is cheap alternatives, please send them my way.

Things I learned after becoming Vegan,"Things I learned after becoming Vegan;

‚Ä¢ If you feed animals and care for them temporarily, it's perfectly fine to send them to slaughterhouses, scare the living shit out of them, fire a bolt into their head and cut their throats. This is known as 'respecting the animals'. Thanking them for their 'sacrifice' (when they had no choice at all anyway) makes everything perfectly fine.

‚Ä¢ Non-vegans buy their cow lactation fluid from ethical, non-enslaving, non-exploitative, non-harmful, beautiful green pasture farms that treat the cows like absolute royalty. All of the animals live their entire lives happily giving their lactation fluid to humans instead of feeding it to their babies. The cows and their babies grow old together and die naturally in their sleep. Cows exist solely for human benefit.

‚Ä¢ As a society and species, we should exploit every animal on this earth. Exploiting and slaughtering animals is consistent with 'conservation', and this word makes us feel better about exploiting and slaughtering animals. Oh, except dogs and cats, who should be treated like royalty and are exempt.

‚Ä¢ We should be angry at people who hurt animals, however we should ignore and defend the hurt, exploitation, slavery and pain that the animals in our fridge/freezer endured.

‚Ä¢ Kicking, hurting and killing a single animal is absolutely not okay, however building large sheds/factories and hurting and killing millions of animals is logical and perfectly fine.

‚Ä¢ When presented with facts that list compassinate and logical reasons to make changes to our lifestyles, it is easier to ignore and avoid the facts and continue on a path of destruction and selfishness. Changing our mentality and actions for the benefit of others is absolutely out of the question and illogical. Except for recycling at home. Recycling helps the environment and makes us feel good.

‚Ä¢ If other people throughout our history have made the conscious decision to enslave, exploit and kill others, we should do it too. It makes sense. Exploiting and slaughtering others is what we should all do as human beings. Conscious decisions to have compassion for others is out of the question and illogical. Slavery and slaughter are what we should live for.

‚Ä¢ Protein is what makes us human. I don't know what it really even is, but if other people say it enough times I should just repeat it too. We need to get protein from animals. That is our justification for enslaving and slaughtering animals daily.

‚Ä¢ Although there are millions of people worldwide who survive perfectly fine eating plant foods, which is better for the environment, animals and far more sustainable, we should avoid this at all costs. It makes absolutely no sense to help anyone else, nor ourselves. We should continue to consume things that put us at greater risk.

Why I Am Not a Vegan,"I am an organic vegetarian which means I only eat organic vegetarian food. I‚Äôve been this way for 5-6 years and I feel great. Some people ask if I am a vegan and I am not one. 

I am not a vegan because vegans eat things that I would not give to animals or put in landfills. The food they eat is contaminated with pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, insecticides, etc. It is also grown in sludge (excrement) and has GMOs in it. These things tend to be bad for the human body, the environment and other lifeforms. 

I consider honey to be medicine, so I enjoy swallowing a little each day. Vegans are apparently divided on it, but they tend to avoid it because bees make it. However, honey has health benefits and I think it has benefits that we‚Äôve been unable to measure. There is nothing like it too. Agave and maple do not have the same benefits. 

Organic food can‚Äôt have table salt in it because it contains synthetic additives like sodium aluminosilicate, silicon dioxide and magnesium carbonate. It also can‚Äôt have high fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated oils or artificial sweeteners in it. 

Organic food is healthier than vegan food. For instance, vegans eat processed food, but organic food is unprocessed or minimally processed. It can‚Äôt include synthetic preservatives, artificial colors or artificial flavors to be USDA certified organic food, but vegan food can have those additives. It also can‚Äôt have synthetic antibiotics or synthetic hormones in it. 

The human body is organic. Yours was organic. I think food is like medicine or poison and you have to make the right choices to become healthy and stay healthy. The healthiest diet you can eat and the best one for the environment and other lifeforms is an organic vegetarian diet. 

Some people eat with a lot of faith, but I don‚Äôt. I hope you eat the healthiest food that you can find and experience good health. The old adage ‚Äúan ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure‚Äù is true. Good luck.

I know this is a pretty specific situation but would be interested to hear your thoughts on the ethics of this kind of medical procedure.

A few of days ago, I noticed the tint of my urine change from yellow, to a deeper yellow. Looking into it, I've found the colour of my urine associated with serious dehydration and liver damage.

First attempt at vegan um...stew?,"I thought this would be chili but I don't have chili powder, so...I think that means it's a stew. 

I fried up about a third of a large white onion and some garlic in coconut oil. Threw in a can of chick peas, black eyed, and black beans after rinsing them well. Then a can of tomato sauce. I let that cook on low for a bit while I thought about the fact that more needed to go into it.

So I had some chopped baby bellas. Threw those in there. I have a lot of kale-- and my only regret with this is that I didn't rip it into smaller pieces. I'm new at kale. It's pretty tough. I chopped up 5 potatoes and threw those in there and turned up the heat for a while. I recently was doing reno on my kitchen so I don't even know where half my spices are. I used pepper... no salt, surprisingly. I overdo salt all the time. I love salt. Salt is the salt of the earth.

So anyway, I let it cook most of the evening. I kept tasting it. It was kinda bitter. So I added some sugar (like gramma used to do). Then I added more sugar. Then it was better. I grabbed myself a cup of the stuff to try. Omg the sauce was sauce, but everything else was awesome. I didn't think I'd like it so damn much. I think I can do this!

I‚Äôve been a vegan for 10 years and have been suffering from SIBO/IBS for the last 2 years. A vegan diet is completely incompatible with the diets recommended for SIBO. I am depressed and really looking for help/suggestions,"I got bad food poisoning two years ago coming back from a 2 week vacation in Thailand. Ever since then I‚Äôve been suffering from SIBO which is incredibly difficult to treat. I was given 1 round of an antibiotic Xifaxan in January which helped immensely but I still tested positive for sibo and am just finishing a 20 day supply of Xifaxan with no real improvements. I‚Äôve seen 5 specialists and none have been able to help.

The issue with the diets people recommend for SIBO is that it excludes most carbs and lots of fiber. So rule out legumes, grains, fruits, and a bunch of vegetables.

I‚Äôd never not be vegan it‚Äôs really not an option especially 10 years in. Meat is repulsive. Idk how I‚Äôm supposed to restrict my diet even further trying to treat SIBO.

It‚Äôs rather debilitating and I‚Äôm a petite person with a huge bloated belly like legit I look mad pregnant. It has made me extremely depressed to the point of hopelessness/suicidal ideation. I‚Äôm at my wits end. I had an AMAZING digestive tract pre Thailand, it was one of the best parts of my vegan diet. Now, every bowel movement is miserable and nothing has helped.

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt you quit veganism for one day‚Äù
‚ÄúHaha I‚Äôm actually doing you a favour because I‚Äôm saving your food from being eaten by my food‚Äù 
‚Äú you know you‚Äôre the one ruining the planet with your vegan diet‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy do you have to eat so weird‚Äù
‚ÄúVegan food is gross‚Äù
‚ÄúCome have some of this [insert non vegan food item here] it‚Äôs vegan I swear‚Äù


*Waves food in my face* ‚Äúmmm bet you miss this‚Äù
‚ÄúWhen are you going to eat real food‚Äù
‚ÄúThey were made for food, it doesn‚Äôt matter what happened to them‚Äù
*they tell everyone I‚Äôm vegan and then later on mention the stereotype of vegans always telling everyone they‚Äôre vegan*
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not even a big deal‚Äù 

*they like to try and get into arguments with me when I‚Äôm trying to avoid talking about veganism because I‚Äôm tired of having to defend myself*
‚ÄúYou‚Äôll understand real life when you‚Äôre older‚Äù
‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre a real adult you‚Äôll think differently‚Äù 

*they also constantly ask why vegans make vegan products to resemble animal products, I‚Äôve answered this a ton (we don‚Äôt object to the flavour, we object to the cruelty and killing of living beings) but at this point they‚Äôre just asking because they think it makes vegans look dumb*

* they also constantly talk about how I must miss meat, or cheese or any other non vegan food product* 
*they also love to tell me how I‚Äôm not really vegan because of mistakes I‚Äôve made (I know this isn‚Äôt true)*
‚ÄúVeganism is a choice, being keto isn‚Äôt (they‚Äôre keto, I just find this one very laughable though haha)‚Äù 
‚Äú you must not like us anymore because you never eat supper with us‚Äù 
‚ÄúPeople are just too sensitive about these things now days‚Äù
*they are also think that vegan products shouldn‚Äôt use words like milk, burger, sausage, butter cheese, etc which is ridiculous* 


There‚Äôs about a million more things they say and do but I‚Äôm blanking. I guess I shouldn‚Äôt be surprised about my dad and stepmoms behaviour. They seem to think vegans, environmentalist, liberals, etc are all dumb and just need to grow up and be real adults.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18293883

Most recent studies using more sensitive techniques for detecting B12 deficiency have found that 68% of vegetarians and 83% of vegans are B12 deficient, compared to just 5% of omnivores. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12816782 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10966896 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10552882

On paper, calcium intake is similar in vegetarians and omnivores (probably because both eat dairy products), but is much lower in vegans, who are often deficient. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21139125 http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/70/3/543s.full

Vegetarians and omnivores have similar levels of serum iron, but levels of ferritin‚Äîthe long-term storage form of iron‚Äîare lower in vegetarians than in omnivores. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24871479

Fruits and Vegetables https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12064344

This is significant, because ferritin depletion is the first stage of iron deficiency. Moreover, although vegetarians often have similar iron intakes to omnivores on paper, it is more common for vegetarians (and particularly vegans) to be iron deficient. For example, this study of 75 vegan women in Germany found that 40% of them were iron deficient, despite average iron intakes that were above the recommended daily allowance. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14988640 http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/3/633S.long

many plant foods that contain zinc also contain phytate, which inhibits zinc absorption. Vegetarian diets tend to reduce zinc absorption by about 35% compared with omniovorous diet. http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/3/633S.long

Thus, even when the diet meets or exceeds the RDA for zinc, deficiency may still occur. One study suggested that vegetarians may require up to 50% more zinc than omnivores for this reason. http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/3/633S.long

"Vegan ""challenge"" videos seriously depress me","
I just watched a 7 day vegan challenge video by a fairly large YouTuber.

It turned out exactly as you'd expect- vegan junk food and ice cream, concern about protein, subtle jabs at vegans (""guess this means I'm a better person than you now!""), comments about how vegan meat substitutes are gross, etc.

The YouTuber concluded that it was not as hard as they thought (even said it was fun)... But now they're back to paying for the murder of animals.

??? 
I know it's for entertainment and for clickbait but really?? They literally admitted that it was pretty easy to be vegan and that it was fun but now they're back to supporting cruelty? And pretty much ALL of these challenge videos are full of misinformation, jokes that poke fun at vegans, paranoia about protein, and so on. I don't think that any of this actually convinces viewers to try, especially since most of these people instantly go back to eating animals.

Mild Parent Success,"I'm almost 40 and visited my folks who live across the country. This was my second time visiting since going vegan. 

We had a big dinner with my vegan meatballs and everyone loved it. They were much more understanding and open minded than my visit last year. 

The next day my parents asked about vegetarianism. I explained the dairy industry is worse, with the extra layer of cruelty on top of all the cruelty of the meat industry. I asked them why a cow produces milk, what happens to their babies, how do they stay pregnant, and much like myself, my parents said they had never even thought about that at all, and actually seemed affected by what I said!

That night I managed to talk them into watching an Earthling Ed video, the one where he gives a 30 minute talk to a classroom. The next morning my Dad said he's getting more and more convinced, and would actually cut out meat. My parents were forwarding the video to their friends.

A few days later I watched What the Health with my mom. She was so into it, following along, being shocked as the realisations hit her, just as it did with me. After the movie, she was writing emails to her friends about it. Over the next few days I would hear my mom talking to other family members about the movie, reciting certain moments. It actually gave me this warm feeling inside.

I'm back in Seattle, and yesterday my Dad sent me an email saying he has been good about cutting out meat, but dairy is just difficult because it's in so many foods. It's ok to me that he's made that one step. My parents are pretty old. He also told me he's proud of me, and I don't know about any of you but that's something I don't hear. I'm proud of him too.

"Red and processed meat are OK to eat, controversial new guidelines claim - DEBUNKED.","Honestly tired of the reporting. Did no one fact-check this study?

A recent study was published by Annals of Internal Medicine. I usually don't even look at pro-meat studies because they are easily debunked (usually funded by the meat industry, glaring methodology problems, not factoring in additional variables, etc), but this one is a meta study of four studies, which are themselves meta-studies of 100+ studies each. It's being reported left and right so I want to address it.

The goal of the post is to dissect this study and (hopefully) debunk its claims. Hopefully to get ahead of the media's reporting on it. 

[Link to the paper here](https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2752328/unprocessed-red-meat-processed-meat-consumption-dietary-guideline-recommendations-from)

##The recommendation.

What most media outlets focus on is the recommendation itself.

Their recommendation is as follows:

&gt;For adults 18 years of age or older, we suggest continuing current processed meat consumption (weak recommendation, low-certainty evidence). Again, 11 of 14 panel members voted for a continuation of current processed meat consumption, and 3 voted for a weak recommendation to reduce processed meat consumption.

Why make this recommendation based on low-certainty evidence? 

##Evidence

&gt;we found low- to very low-certainty evidence that diets lower in unprocessed red meat may have little or no effect on the risk for major cardiometabolic outcomes and cancer mortality and incidence.

The evidence for this is from a meta-study with 0 citations that was published *the same day* and was authored by the same people. They hand-picked studies funded by Meat and Livestock, Australian Pork, ad National Cattlemen's Beef Association. So although *this* study wasn't founded by any party, it uses a study that uses studies that *did*. Pretty scummy IMO. 

Unless I missed something when reviewing that article, it seems they completely cherry picked the data as well. Of the 13190 records they screened, where they identified they have no duplicates - they picked a mere 1507 for no explainable reason. Then they took those 1507 and cut them down to 24 because they didn't fit the design of the study. So out of 13190, they took 24 studies that confirmed their bias. That's 0.1%. **Talk about cherry picking data.**

##Conclusion

This post got really long, and I've only addressed one line in their article. But it's clearly BS. Almost **ALL** of their sources are meta-studies they themselves had written with 0 citations that were published on the same day. Having looked at a few of them, it's very clear they grossly misrepresented the data to fit an agenda, and have hidden behind the term meta-analysis.",vegan,KinOfMany,1570010936,0,True,2019-10-02

Favourite (and one of the oldest) Vegan Poems,"\- Al-Ma øarri, (Born December 973), - a poem called, ""I no longer steal from Nature."" He was a Syrian philosopher and poet, and one of the first vegans to write about it!

**""Do not unjustly eat fish the water has given up, And do not desire as food the flesh of slaughtered animals, Or the white milk of mothers who intended its pure draught for their young, not noble ladies. And do not grieve the unsuspecting birds by taking eggs; for injustice is the worst of crimes. And spare the honey which the bees get industriously from the flowers of fragrant plants; For they did not store it that it might belong to others, Nor did they gather it for bounty and gifts. I washed my hands of all this; and wish that I Perceived my way before my hair went gray!""**

I wasn‚Äôt surprised of course, but a bit annoyed. I corrected them and said no dairy. For some reason I was given fish the next day. At that point I had to eat because I hadn‚Äôt eaten anything with proteins in it. After that my meals were vegan but I couldn‚Äôt keep eating them because they weren‚Äôt nutritious at all. I was given celery, carrots and cucumbers with a vegetable juice box. That was it. Same thing the day after. It took them 2 days to give me a few cubes of raw tofu and a veggie patty (the kind made of beans) but it was very inconsistent. I have no idea how long I‚Äôll still be in the hospital because my medication has to be adjusted so I had to make exceptions to not starve, meaning eating meat and dairy a few times and it grossed me out every time. Right now I have the vegetarian option ticked but I still have to make exceptions because even that one is lacking. 

A few weeks ago I signed a petition for more vegan options in canteens and public establishments and I‚Äôm really glad I did after witnessing myself how terrible it is. It‚Äôs not just a ‚Äúoh, all hospital food is gross‚Äù because the omni menu is actually very decent and surprising.

Thoughts on HappyCow?,"Little background - recently went vegan after listening to some Earthling Ed talks and stopped purchasing meat/dairy products as of last week for good.

I live in a medium sized city where there are a growing, yet small amount of vegan friendly restaurants and food stores. I've been trying to find out the tools I can use to find these places easier and I stumbled upon HappyCow which this community seems to swear by.

Have you used HappyCow? Do you really like it?

I've personally find it extremely unsettling that it is the only vegan-friendly restaurant finder on the market, as the design of it very poor, its clunky, cheaply-made, and ultimately I've not found it to be too much more helpful than Yelp or Google reviews.

I was out for drinks with a friend and found some delicious Seitan Wings on their menu, nowhere to be found on HappyCow.

Also I find it interesting that HappyCow is not specifically catered to vegans, and instead vegetarians AND vegans, even though we stand by very different principles.

Not doing enough as a vegan,"So I've been vegan for over 2 years now and about a year after I first went vegan, I started watching some vegan youtubers and joined a few local vegan communities to keep learning more about the industries as well as the health benefits of being on a vegan diet. At first when I began watching these channels and going to these events, things seemed pretty civil (e.g. they would just explain facts about the industries or scientific studies and highlight why it is important to be vegan). It definitely seemed great in comparison to some of the extreme, and arguably aggressive, vegan youtube channels that I had seen previously. However, I've noticed that some of these channels that I've been watching have been becoming more similar to the latter. I no longer feel welcome in the community as it keeps being reiterated to me by these channels (as well as some vegans I have met in real life) that I am not doing enough for the movement because I'm not involved in activism. A handful of vegans I have met in my personal life have told me that I may as well not be vegan if I'm not going to help out in activism. 

When I first went vegan I did try to help out in activism, whenever people in my personal life would try to debunk or criticise veganism I would argue back with facts, and I joined the committee of my university's vegan society to create artwork for activism. But then my physical health started to get in the way, and as a result I was struggling with my university work, I became too fatigued to spend time doing hobbies, and I stopped trying to defend myself when people criticised veganism or criticised me for being vegan. I couldn't bear to go to animal rights marches because my social anxiety became exacerbated by my health problems. I no longer had energy to create the artwork for my university's vegan society, and if I'm honest, I never enjoyed doing it in the first place. I love to create conceptual and meaningful artwork but the ideas aren't something which can be forced. A lot of the pieces I paint are much more related to personal struggles because art has always served a therapeutic purpose for me, and having to keep trying so hard to come up with inventive ways to get a message across for vegan artwork killed the fun of painting for me. I'm not sure what I should do anymore. Even though health wise I'm not particularly in a good position to be pushing myself to do more for activism, other vegans keep telling me that I'm not doing enough, that being vegan isn't enough and that I should be prioritising fighting for these animals' rights.",vegan,MisfitAntoinette,1570029529,8,True,2019-10-02

I have been so angry recently and I don't want to be because it sucks but how can you not be?
Trying to be nice when people continue to ignore and destroy the planet that we have to share is just impossible at this point.

Some thoughts before going to sleep.,"When somebody would want to know my opinion about meat regarding its taste. I'd say ""I'm sad that I know meat, cheese and dairy is delicious but its taste doesn't justify cruelty animals are under and their deaths"". I'm vegan only for 10 months but still all those beings that I devoured, all those lifes I took. I'd like to go back in time and tell younger me what I did when I chose to eat everything that brings so much pain to the world. There is nothing else I can do right now. But for real... We should stop deaths of humans and animals. We should find a way that people won't eat other living beings such as animals and will still live with full tummy. It's like holocaust for  animals. It's just too sad to think about it. It's even worse that people don't act on this(or see this). I know that we live in unfair and cruel world and our expectations may be too good to be true. But we need to do everything we can to be better souls/people. 
What I mean by that is: ""We shouldn't let death win. Not so easily."" When I speak about ""death"" I'm speaking about everything that is slipping from our fingers/hands that ""death"" is waiting to take( our lives, lives of the other people and animals lives). ""Death"" is patient and everyone will meet it but you shouldn't help this meeting with ""death"" be faster whether we are speaking about family, people or animals.",vegan,Reditp,1570056413,3,True,2019-10-02

plant-based diet and meds,"Hi all, I've been following a plant-based woe for 17 days. I am so happy to be getting all of my nutritional needs met from beans, grains, fruits and vegetables!

any mexican diet accustomed vegans out there?,"hi! so my whole background is me being vegetarian from when I was 13 to 15, but I went back to eating whatever and whatever my mom made, because I was mostly eating cereal, cheese quesadillas, and sometimes those salad bags. I hate to complain but I got tired of eating the same few things for a couple years, and my family questioning me at every family party. 

I can't tell y'all how many times I've heard ""so you're still not eating meat???"" from relatives

and of course jokes or ridicules, with my dad being a meat manager. my family was super relieved when I started eating meat with them again and said they knew id get over it, and continued to joke about it for a couple months, then it went back to ""normal.""

my plan was to go back to being vegetarian whenever I live on my own then transition into veganism. I'm a freshman in college now (community college, im still at home), and I want to become vegan. vegetarianism is a seemingly nice sidetrack, but all the way is the best way. am I right?

need some friendly advice from some fellow vegans regarding cats.,"

I, my wife, and son are all vegan. we‚Äôve been vegan for a few years now. we‚Äôve all taken steps to veganize pretty much every aspect of our lives. we do still own a few leather goods from before we were vegan, but since becoming vegan we have stopped buying all products containing animal elements. we also try to make sure whatever we are buying is ethically sourced whenever possible. 

earlier this week my wife was buying a new pet carrier for our two dogs (who are also both vegan, we‚Äôve done a lot of research so we are making sure they are getting all the necessary nutrition they need) when she met 2 cats who were from a local shelter. our pet supply store sometimes hosts animals like this to try and give them a better chance at being adopted. these cats are brother and sister, five months old, rescued from texas. I guess they have been at our pet supply store for a while and are going to have to got back to the shelter this sunday where their fate will be uncertain, if you gather my meaning. 

my wife and son want to rescue them. 

now I have done a lot of research on the subject and know that cats, unlike dogs, cannot go vegan. they are obligate carnivores. there is no healthy way, as of yet, for them to live a plant based life. 

on one hand, it would be great to save these cats from an uncertain fate and i‚Äôd be happy to take them in but...

we have put a lot of thought and effort into living as cruelty free as humanly possible in modern society. I feel good knowing I don‚Äôt contribute to the torture and death of untold billions on a yearly basis. I feel more assured in my activism both in cyberspace and meatspace knowing I can talk the talk *and* walk the walk. 

I view the idea of taking these cats in as a major blemish on all that. I think i‚Äôd feel guilty literally every time I fed them. my wife argues that they are alive now and if they did manage to get adopted without our help, they‚Äôd still be getting fed animal meat. if they don‚Äôt get adopted we would be contributing to their deaths through inaction. 

I just don‚Äôt know if rescuing them justifies the moral cost of keeping them alive in my mind. I would really love to take them home, but I am incredibly conflicted about the ethics of the situation. 

if you are someone who has dealt with a similar situation or just has helpful input, i‚Äôm all ears. please keep comments respectful, constructive, and chill. i‚Äôm asking this here explicitly to avoid the static of general reddit so please keep flaming to a minimum.

i think i understand how some vegans and vegetarians feel about meat after today,"so, there's this thing called Chapulines that i found out about a few days ago that i thought seemed interesting. in some rural areas of mexico, they either toast or fry grasshoppers. it probably started as a desperation food i'm guessing, but now it's just normal. so then i thought ""hey, there are grasshoppers where i live, and i like to cook. why don't i try to make this?""  


so this morning i wake up nice and early, go out with a bug net and catch some grasshoppers for a few hours. i had to kill and clean them (remove their guts, wings, and legs, and heads), and i'm not disturbed by the idea of killing and cleaning an animal, i've done it before because i used to hunt when i was younger as a family activity, and i'm no stranger to killing spiders i find in my house because i hate them, but doing this to bugs, knowing that it was because i was intending to eat them, was such a disgusting experience. the more i did it, and the more time passed, the more i realized there was no way i can force myself to cook these things, let alone put them in my mouth. if i did, i would probably puke.   


i'm still going to continue to eat meat, this hasn't turned me into a vegan, but i used to have a friend who was a vegetarian, and she explained that she decided she was done with meat when she was a kid and she watched her parents preparing a turkey. the whole thing of dismantling it and handling all these gross slimy animal parts disgusted her so much that she couldn't eat meat afterward. i could never put myself in her shoes, but i think i have some semblance of that feeling now. it will probably sound like a bit of a stretch, but i honestly think the feeling i felt earlier today was either very similar, or the same as how she feels about meat.",vegan,smemmy,1570066989,2,True,2019-10-02

"PA Diary study recommends ""premium"" be placed on plant milks","I'm sure as we all know, the diary industry has been facing a lot of problems. Low prices and constant oversupply of cow milk have been killing off a lot of small farms and forcing consolidation of production. So, instead of recognizing the problem is simply one of demand, the dairy industry has been trying to blame all their problems on their favorite whipping boy: plant milks.

The study was led by PA state senator Judy Schwank (D). There are some summary points listed on her page:

However, the actual study is listed here:

There are some disturbing recommendations in section A: 

* Regulate plant milk as a Class V product and make it separate from ""fluid milk"", whatever that's supposed to mean.
* Expand the Milk Marketing Law, a dairy specific regulation for the Milk Marketing Board, to oversee the marketing of plant based milk.
* Impose a tax on plant milks that would funnel revenue into the Milk Marketing Fund.

While none of these are law, it's important to be aware of these things since something like this will be sent to lawmakers and not really be questioned.

Let's make abolition of animal agriculture and fishing a reality together! Join ANIMAL REBELLION action from 07 October!," 

It is time for the governments across the world to call it as it is - the **animal agriculture and fishing industries** destroy nature at a scale no other human activity is even capable of. They are **inflicting intolerable, yet unnecessary, suffering on billions of innocent animals**, they cause **ecocide, deforestation, desertification, biodiversity annihilation, soil erosion, extinction of species, reckless land grabs, depletion of oceans** \- all of these make agricultural and fishing practices incompatible with any aspirations to make human existence on this planet either sustainable or ethically just.

This is why **Animal Rebellion** was created.

We are a mass volunteer movement, employing Non-Violent Direct Action methods (e.g. Civil Disobedience), demanding that the¬†governments abolish the destructive animal farming and fishing industries, and lead a **transition to 100% plant-based food production systems.** We recognise that a vegan, plant-based food system is the only food system that can minimise the risk of climate breakdown, halt mass extinction and avert social collapse.¬†

The Rebellion begins on 07 October in London, UK (and other places across the world), where in solidarity with Extinction Rebellion, Animal Rebellion will mobilise thousands of animal advocates for a two-week rebellion. Together, we will deliver the result and bring about this massive change on a global scale!

If you want to help change the world by ending animal agriculture and fishing, this is what you can do:

"How to deal with vegan ""gotcha""s?? Crucified for 'not being 100% vegan'.","I'm going to preface this by saying that I've only been vegan for about 3 years and while I would prefer that everyone else was too, I've never been confrontational about 'converting' other people to become vegans, but instead live as an example of someone that lives a perfectly normal lifestyle while omitting animal products from it as much as possible.

So today at work we had a celebration. And just like every other celebration there was food (all non-vegan). Per usual, I deny the food and the topic of my veganism comes into conversation. So we end up talking a bit and eventually my coworkers reach the conclusion that I'm a fake vegan because I don't eat a 100% raw vegan diet and am ""only a vegan until it's not convenient"" mind you, none of them are vegan.

These are a few of their reasons with some of my counter-points (but I really need help on this front)

Them: ""I saw you eating fig bars and swedish fish, those aren't vegan.""

Me: ""Well actually the brand of fig bars I was eating are **certified vegan** and swedish fish are vegan too unless you get the ones with beeswax.""

Them: ""But what about the sugar?! The sugar in those products were processed with bone char!""
(surprised they even bothered to know this)

Me: ""Still no, in order for a product to be certified vegan, it has to meet a list of requirements that insure the product is such. I don't know about the swedish fish though.""

Them: ""So the sugar could have bone char in it, you just don't care to know, so you aren't a vegan. Also did you know wheat isn't vegan because mice get caught in the process?? That means you can't have bread either.""

Me: ""Well typically, veganism is about practicing it as much as possible, and companies aren't required to state the sugar refining process for the sugar in their products, so there is no real way to know without them stating it. And for that mice thing, it's not like they're intentionally adding mice to the product, it just happens that they get mixed up in there, like there are bugs in like everything we eat.""

Them: ""So then why are you eating them if there is a possibility of them having animal products?? You say practice as much as possible, but you could stop eating them and only eat vegetables. There is no reason that you can't do that.""

Me: ""Well yeah, I could go that route and definitely would like to be able to do that, but  right now I'm not ready to make that leap.""

Them: ""So you're only a vegan until it's not convenient? Then you're not a vegan.""

Me:""No, it's just impractical to believe, in the modern world, that I can be 100% vegan, unless I live in some shack in the woods eating homegrown potatoes. There isn't a such thing as 100% vegan, and some of the issues are very negligible. Take for instance, cars. You'd be hard pressed to find an all vegan car, unless you shelled out a buttload of money to get it custom made. Sometimes it's not feasible for everyone.""

Them: ""Well if you're really vegan, that's the price you have to pay. You could save up for that. You don't get to pick and choose, you either are or aren't vegan. It's not hard. You're just a hypocrite.""
(Implying that I can't drive unless the car is vegan)

At this point, I kind of ended the conversation, but as someone who has never really dealt with people being so persistent about me being a 'fake vegan' I couldn't help but think about some of the things they said.

Other points they've made during other times:

-You don't know if our handsoap was tested on animals so you can't use it 

-Flu shots have eggs in them so you can't get one

-You still wear leather (all purchased before I was vegan) so you're not vegan

-You didn't intervene when I killed that fly the other day, so you don't care about animals


**TLDR:  Non-vegan Co-workers give me grief over miniscule points to counter modern veganism for folks who aren't ""all in"" according to their definition of what it is to be vegan.**

"""Controlling the population""","I live in Texas where hunting culture is huge. The other night when I was hanging out with some friends, they started talking about going hog hunting together.

Only humans breed animals in big, ugly factories, torture them and steal their children, rape them and keep them locked up in tiny cages, cut off their limbs whilst they're still screaming and grind baby chicks up alive for their chicken nuggets, and then call their diets natural and compare it to the animal kingdom and the circle of life.

Looking for some info,"Hello.  I'm new to the vegan world and guess not fully completely vegan yet as I'm looking for some answers and insight that people can give.  A little background on me real quick is I'm 36, diabetic (T1.5 managed via diet/metformin) and also just had a minor heart attack.  I'm trying to make changes to prevent that.  Before my heart attack I was a 100% clean eater, berries, vegetables, dairy  and lean meat once or twice per week.  I am not a fan of supplements and prefer to get all my nutrients from whole real foods.  With being both diabetic and having heart issues they both seem to have conflicting nutritional needs...no carbs or sugar for diabetes...low fat, sodium for heart...which seems to leave almost nothing to eat.  After doing research and such I'm not as concerned about the carbs effect on my BG (although a little concerned about sugar in fruit, guess I""ll have to experiment)  but I'm concerned with nutrients and best ways to obtain macro and micro nutrients from completely clean sources.  Seems like the biggest issue is Vitamin B12 and protein (got most of my protein from dairy).  I read about almond milk fortified with b12 but every almond milk i look at is filled with crap on the ingredients list.  So TLDR I'm looking for some help on figuring out nutritional sources that are clean, and can add calories as right now I seem to only be at around 500cals for the day

And I just had a friend post about how if the food network had a vegan cooking show she‚Äôd be obsessed. But... she‚Äôs not vegan...?

Passive Marketing and Spending of Your Vegan Money at Corporate Fast Food Restaurants is Contributing to the Increase in Meat Consumption and Leading to the Death of More Animals,"I know this is a very hot topic at the moment and I'm guaranteed to piss a lot of people off, so before you down vote, please hear me out.

**TLDR: by passively marketing for and spending money at unethical fast food companies, you are giving them more customers, driving the sale of meat products and increasing profits to be used in furthering the suffering of animals.**

Business Insider recently published an article discussing an increase in sales of BEEF Whoppers, due to the release and popularity of the Impossible Whopper. Yes you heard that right. [You can read the article here](https://www.businessinsider.com/impossible-whopper-boosts-burger-king-sales-2019-9). This news comes to light the same year as the USDA's report showing meat consumption on the rise in the United States.

I see no reason not to assume that meat sales have also increased for other unethical fast food corporations like KFC, due to their vegan targeted marketing campaign.

I know there is an urge among a lot of vegans to one day be able to fully participate in mainstream consumerist culture. But we can not trust or rely on corporations to make ethical decisions regarding animal welfare, especially when the suffering of animals is a commodity and completely tied to capitalism.

There was a time I believed that our community was much smarter then this. It's inherent in veganism to question the actions of these companies and how they market to us. We do this every single day. Every time you see an advertisement from the dairy industry or when you go shopping and look at the ingredients on the back of a box. If you are vegan long enough it becomes second nature.

So why is it that this all goes out the window when corporations like Burger King, KFC and Impossible Foods offer up new marketing campaigns directly aimed at our dollars? It's just post after post of community members doing the marketing work for these terrible companies, recruiting friends and strangers to give their dollars, dollars that will be used to commodify more animals.

Sure, if given the choice I'd rather have someone that was going to buy a burger, choose a vegan version. But if you are vegan, and you give Burger King or KFC your money, you are not doing any animal a favor. It isn't activism and you are contributing to the problem. You have a responsibility as a vegan to do what is in your means to limit the suffering of animals.

I'm sure someone will leave a comment regarding my privilege or purist ideals or something of that nature (go to way of trying to shut down dialog). For context, I've been vegan for 18 years. Long enough to remember there being no vegan restaurants. I grew up in poverty, have been homeless, and squatted for many years. There were times I had to dumpster for food or starve. During much of those difficult times I still held strong to my ideals. There is a responsibility that we have when taking on the ideals of veganism. It's to do what ever is in our means to end the suffering of animals. Not just when it's convenient...insert fast food joke here.",vegan,djangokill,1567386292,3,True,2019-09-01
How do you find motivation to keep going?,"I don't mean in terms of veganism, I mean in terms of...everything.

I've been pretty depressed for a while but since becoming vegan after years of denial it's made everything so much worse. I see so much suffering in everything now. I was waiting for a bus yesterday and heard sheep... I looked up and saw a lorry pass literally just filled with sheep, all crammed together. I felt like crying. I feel so pathetic but at the same time, I don't get how anyone else manages. I don't get how you all manage.

Sometimes I feel like even the people on this sub don't get the extent to which is problem lies. About 70,000,000,000 animals are killed each year by humans. That level of suffering, even if you're generous and assume every one of them lived happily until the point of slaughter, is just incomprehensible.

I seriously feel like just giving up and ending everything sometimes. I feel like I'm genuinely unable to cope with the people on this planet. How do you all keep going?",vegan,birthday_account,1567387121,16,True,2019-09-01

One of the most consistent epidemiological associations between diet and human disease risk is the impact of red meat consumption (beef, pork, and lamb, particularly in processed forms). While risk estimates vary, associations are reported with all-cause mortality, colorectal and other carcinomas, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, and possibly other inflammatory processes https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098299716300401?via%3Dihub




The population-based prospective Cohort of Swedish Men (COSM) included 37 035 men, aged 45-79 y, with no history of HF, ischemic heart disease, or cancer at baseline. Meat consumption was assessed with a self-administered questionnaire in 1997. During a mean follow-up of 11.8 y, 2891 incidences and 266 deaths from HF were ascertained. Consumption of processed meat was statistically significant positively associated with risk of HF in both age- and multivariable-adjusted models. Men who consumed ‚â•75 g/d processed meat compared to those who consumed &lt;25 g/d had a 1.28 (95% CI: 1.10-1.48, P-trend=0.01) higher risk of HF incidence and 2.43 (95% CI: 1.52-3.88, P-trend&lt;0.001) higher risk of HF mortality. The consumption of unprocessed meat was not associated with increased risk of incidence of HF or mortality from HF. http://circheartfailure.ahajournals.org/content/early/2014/06/11/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.113.000921.short

There was no convincing lack of association between saturated fat and CHD mortality (1.15, 0.97 to 1.36; P=0.10). For trans fats, one to six prospective cohort studies for each association were pooled (two to seven comparisons with 12‚Äâ942-230‚Äâ135 participants). Total trans fat intake was associated with all cause mortality (1.34, 1.16 to 1.56), CHD mortality (1.28, 1.09 to 1.50), and total CHD (1.21, 1.10 to 1.33) but not ischemic stroke (1.07, 0.88 to 1.28) or type 2 diabetes (1.10, 0.95 to 1.27). Industrial, but not ruminant, trans fats were associated with CHD mortality (1.18 (1.04 to 1.33) v 1.01 (0.71 to 1.43)) and CHD (1.42 (1.05 to 1.92) v 0.93 (0.73 to 1.18)). Ruminant trans-palmitoleic acid was inversely associated with type 2 diabetes (0.58, 0.46 to 0.74).

Myocardial infarction in red meat consumption by Oxford study Red meat consumption was significantly positively associated with ferritin concentrations and MI risk [HR per 50 g daily intake: 1.18 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.33)], but no significant associations with stroke risk and CVD mortality were observed. While direct associations between ferritin concentrations and MI risk as well as CVD mortality were significant in age- and sex-adjusted Cox regression models, these associations were substantially attenuated and no longer significant after multivariable adjustment for classical CVD risk factors. Strikingly, ferritin concentrations were positively associated with a majority of classical CVD risk factors (age, male sex, alcohol intake, obesity, inflammation, and lower education). https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-abstract/107/1/113/4763681?redirectedFrom=fulltext

Can't be vegan,"I've been plant based for a few months now, and ""mostly"" vegan (on/off, mostly on) for nearly 2 years and I am going to give up. Originally I wanted to just go vegetarian, but I became lactose intolerant at the start as well and I don't really like eggs that much so I was essentially vegan with a little cheese and meat in between. I'm not an animal activist by any means but I thought cows and pigs and chickens are cute and I wanted to be healthy which were my two main reasons. However it is a challenge to balance it right and I keep feeling weak. I supplement vitamin d and take soy milk fortified with b12. Upon reviewing my bloodwork I noticed some things were off, my blood sugar is within normal range but higher than it was before (in the 90s now, before 81). And my blood pressure increased from 100/67 to 112/74. Also my creatine levels were low, iron was ok. I did notice how much lean muscle I lost and it feels like my body fat % went up. I tried to eat as healthy as possible, get fortified soy milk, grains (I admit mostly white rice, but whole wheat bread and quinoa), tofu, veggies, and a some beans/peanuts - can't eat too much because it gives me gas and bloating. Ultimately I feel like I am weak a lot and now I'm noticing my hair is a bit more brittle and dry too. I'm guessing it's because I don't eat enough calories, protein, or fat. I relied on carbs and not enough protein. I'm a college student surviving on dining hall food or budget groceries at walmart and don't have time to plan around all these things. It's very hard to maintain in the long term. I realize if I was left in the wild to fend for myself I would end up hunting an animal at some point.

Single and young vegans. PLEASE READ!,"
My fellow vegans, especially those of you who are single and young, do not get into a serious relationship based on a vegan bond, however strong it is. Even if you want to, make sure they have been vegan/vegetarian for a VERY long time (almost their entire life). I learnt this the hard way and I do not want this to happen to anyone. Especially to those who are strict about only dating vegans/vegetarians. 

My wife was the staunchest vegan I have ever known. I met her in the New Zealand vegan dating group three years ago. Few years after adopting the vegan lifestyle in 2013, she started experiencing gut illnesses. A month ago, she was convinced that plants &amp; carbs were the culprits for her poor gut health after doing tons of research and wanted to stray from veganism. I objected first due to the strong bond we had due to veganism.  After a few discussions, my love and care took over and I told her I'd be okay with whatever she eats as long as she is healthy and happy. She tried dairy and eggs first. There was improvement but not as much as she hoped for.

She saw a doctor and he said her gut health was pretty poor and that she was pretty close to Chron's Disease. The doctor told her to eat mostly animal based foods such as meat, eggs and dairy. Apparently, fiber makes her guts flare up. Even though veganism was the sole foundation of our relationship and that I haven't eaten meat or eggs my whole life, I was prepared to have a marriage where one member is a hardcore omni. But things changed for the worse and everything went downhill. 

She started doing research about ex-vegans and she started turning to the dark side by the day. When I met her, she used to debate with everyone that humans were herbivores/frugivores. Now she is convinced humans are OBLIGATE CARNIVORES. The body apparently needs animal cholesterol to function and plants are 100% detrimental to human health. (It gets worse)

Everyday, I was waking up to her shoving ""credible research"" about pro-meat/anti-vegan studies in my face. Apparently some study showed that vegans have more brain shrinkage over time as opposed to omnis. She kept pestering me to eat meat otherwise I'd go retarded. She shared another research that stated it's technically impossible to be vegan because when you're on a plant-based diet, your body eats on your muscles due to lack of animal protein (It gets worse).

Through a video, she arrived at a conclusion that even herbivores aren't herbivores and they start eating animals due to lack of animal protein. She said it's graphic so I am scared to watch it. If someone has the stomach to watch animal violence, please go ahead and opine on it in the comments:  

https://youtu.be/TdTXaFtDqZE

Oh yes, it still gets worse. As per her research, plants apparently release toxins when they are harvested. These toxins are detrimental for the human body's immune system and can lead to depression, heart disease etc. Whenever I joyfully shared a pic of what I was eating at work, she always scorned at it because it was plant-based and full of toxins. It came to a point where I put my foot down and told her to not impose her omni lifestyle on me in a ""You do you"" way. I also reminded her that when she was vegan, she told me she would leave me instantly if I quit veganism and that it's extremely unfair to change me into the very thing she hated once. Her reply to all of this was ""Fine. I refuse to cook toxins for you from now on"". I keep telling her I have been vegetarian all my life and the farthest I can go is consume dairy from a legit happy cow farm.

We used to feed ducks. Now she eats ducks. Her omni parents were gonna slaughter and eat a rescued chicken in 2018. She cried that it was gonna die so I went out of my way to find a rescue shelter via this group and made her happy. Now she eats chickens and tells me to eat them cuz I am not a cow but a lion, an obligate carnivore. ""Don't be a deluded vegan hippie"" she said. She did petty things like change my name to ""Angry Vegan"" on her phone. The same person who used to share Gary's best speech with her omni friends and family started using the ""circle of life"" argument and claimed she'd even go as far as hunting animals instead of supporting factory farming.  I didn't know who my wife was anymore. We decided to get separated few days ago. I gave it all I had to save this marriage. I really tried but everything was devolving.

How do you cope with vegan related depression?,"When I say vegan related depression, I mean getting depressed about animal cruelty, being bullied for being vegan etc.. Depression runs in my family, I've been clinically depressed since I was a teenager but it seems that no matter how much I try to keep my depression in check, my mood is always brought down whenever I'm reminded of animal cruely or when I see people hating on vegans online. No amount of anti-depressents or healthy living can ever stop me getting depressed about animal cruelty. 

I've been vegan for almost 7 years, and I'm tired of people picking arguments with me whenever they find out I'm vegan. I just don't get what their problem is? I never bring up my veganism unless it's relevant, I try to avoid the topic because talking about veganism just makes me sad. I remember in school the new girl used to offer me snacks in history class and they'd never be vegan and I had to keep saying ""No thanks, I'm good""  for weeks because I didn't want to sound obnoxious by telling her I wouldn't eat her food because I'm vegan. But people in school would still claim that I was preachy and never stopped talking about veganism, when I'd only talk about it if they asked about it. 

I know it sounds dramatic, but I sometimes get so disturbed at the thought of the amount of animals being abused for food, cosmetics, clothing etc, that I think about killing myself because I don't see how I can ever be happy in a world that justifies this amount of senseless cruelty.

"AITA for ""converting"" my brother (11m) and myself (f17) to veganism? (r/vegan edition)","hello kind people of reddit,

i had a heated discussion with my parents yesterday and need some outside view on it. hope it's fine if i post here instead or r/aita because i don't think they would be too understanding about a kid x veganism.

some background info: I turned 95% vegan when I was 8-9 (I basically ate 1 sausage every 2 months) and stopped completely when I turned 13-14. Around a 1,5 years ago (when i ~15) I stopped drinking milk and replaced it with soy/oat milk. I also reduced all my other dairy/egg intake over the months. for the past months my breakfasts, the food I take to school and my dinner have been 100% vegan - but not lunch (which is something my mum makes. it usually includes milk, sometimes eggs).

I took a blood test around 2 months ago and my doc was ""devastated"" about my diet *ugh*.
she said I have to eat fish/meat 2x a week with dairy/eggs everyday (I have a b12/vit d deficiency at the moment). my parents - who have been really sceptical about vegans/vegetarians obviously used the results to blame me and to talk bad about me (check post history for some info). but my stance is that I prefer taking pills over supporting mass murder and rape. I can't imagine myself drinking milk or eating meat ever again. it's just wrong.

my brother (now 11), who watched documentaries in school talked to me about vegetarianism 1-1,5 years ago and after explaining my stance he decided to go vegetarian. my parents have been blaming me since then even though I never forced it onto him and always said it's his choice. he was the one curious about it.

well, I joined a really nice german vegan server which supported me and gave me food ideas for lunch for the past days (classes got cancelled so I had time) so I have been fully vegan for 5 days. I made rice with veggies, baked veggies&amp;potatoes, adapted more fruits to my breakfast etc.

yesterday I was trying out another recipe and my brother decided to tune in and help. We spent 4-5 hours together, prepping food, talking and: watching vids.

I showed him a ""I went vegan for 30 days"" vid, vids about veganism and we watched some gaming clips.
I dont know why. I thought he'd be interested since he is so open about it. we discussed it etc. He completely agreed but I told him not to talk about my parents about to it and to just continue his life as before (I knew they'd be furious). I suggested to him that he may try out my vegan yoghurt next time or to  that we could visit a vegan restaurant nearby (he wanted us to) and he seemed very hyped about it.

well, he is a kid. and he told them. he was sad about our soap being labelled ""milk and honey"" and enthusiastically told my parents about vegan butter which was more cheap. he told them all kinds of things in his little hype. what a cute little lad.

well my parents were furious (my dad way more than my mum), he called me and started screaming. he was about to explode and slammed the desk really bad. he called me selfish and horrible and said I dont decide about my diet until I turn 18 (in march).
He told me veganism is horribly unhealthy and I will suffer longterm effects from it and that it's a stupid trend. He threatened me with all kinds of punishments (taking my phone/pc) but I was the most scared about him hitting me (happens but very rarely).
the thing he was the most furious about was that I was ""converting"" my brother and forcing him into veganism. he said my brother will lack all kinds of vitamins and that he NEEDS milk&amp;egg since he is growing up. I know that this is NOT true but I also know that I won't be able to change his mind.

now I also know that my parents are just really worried about their son and I will talk to my brother about veganism today. I hope we can stick to the compromise I gave him yesterday. he continues his diet but tries out my vegan yoghurt or liverwurst from time to time. I hope if I do this I'll be allowed to stay on my vegan journey.
my parents will not care about facts or studies or anything. they are talking based on emotions.
in addition, my doc recommends an omnivore diet (-_-) and a health consultant.

was it wrong of me to show him 1-2 non graphic vids and talk to him about it? he was genuinely curious.
am I really that selfish? Does he need a non-vegan diet? he barely ate veggies&amp;fruits before but I told him that he needs them so he has been eating them more and more lately. what do I do now?

I am currently in school and I *do not* want to go home. If he forces milk onto me I will refuse and rather starve. Yesterday I wasn't able to express my thoughts but I feel like I fucked up.
Should I just have kept quiet?

I don't know what to do.
Should I also post this on AITA?

What are your best tips for going vegan?,"Hello everyone! 

Recently I decided to start the journey towards becoming vegan and it's something I've attempted or considered before but would eventually find myself incredibly daunted at the thought of starting, and was also in a place with my family where I was living on their food and diets. Now I buy my own groceries and would like to move towards being healthier, and also living better! 

I know the mechanics of how to go vegan and already I eat mostly vegetarian but I still eat chicken. I've never been a fan of red meat in that way but already I've been sometimes at a loss when I look in the fridge to think about what to make for dinner! But I want to change that! 

I'm wondering if you guys had any helpful tips that can make the transition easier/make the cravings for meat less! Or what sneaky things to watch out for as well! Just yesterday I realised that I had to be more careful when buying sweet treats because I need to find alternatives for dairy and small things like that! I've gone on YouTube to learn about making meals and on how to feel full but it's still a rather daunting switch to make!

I'm also finding it hard to go outside with friends now! Recently when I was out with friends to celebrate a birthday, none of the meals were vegan and the only vegetarian option was an appetizer! I've never been a big eater but I still felt a little gypped because of it. 

I just want to get ahead of this lifestyle change and thought some help/pointers would be really useful and let me become vegan in a successful healthy way!",vegan,nikki8195,1567435663,17,True,2019-09-02

Does anybody else kinda resent vegetarians?,"I feel like I almost dislike them more than omnivores, because they have this idea that because they don‚Äôt eat meat, they‚Äôre doing something infinitely better than omnivores, even though they‚Äôre still giving their money to the dairy industry, which goes hand-in-hand with the meat industry. In fact, the fishing industry is just as bad. 

So if their money is still contributing to the problem, what really is the point? To say it‚Äôs for health reasons seems invalid, because dairy products are still bad, so it seems pointless to not just go all-in and be vegan. 

Whenever it‚Äôs come up that I‚Äôm vegan, I immediately get the ‚Äúoh well I‚Äôm vegetarian!‚Äù It‚Äôs almost just as bad as the ‚ÄúI could NEVER give up meat!‚Äù, or (my favorite) ‚ÄúI barely eat meat‚Äù. 
Vegetarian and vegan are on a different spectrum. Vegetarians could waltz on into any Wendy‚Äôs and stuff their faces with a Wendy‚Äôs salad that‚Äôs smothered in cheese and ranch. The only connecting factor is not eating meat. I don‚Äôt think they realize how different it is to live a vegan lifestyle.

I realized my favourite pasta salad recipe is vegan!,"I have been trying to eat completely vegan since last january and just now realized that one of my all time favorite recipes is vegan, so I thought I would share. This has pretty much been my go to meal prep recipe for years because it's so simple to make and doesn't need any fancy ingredients, but is still super delicious. You need: 


-cherry tomatoes (about 500g) 
-one cucumber 
-2 cloves of garlic 
-black olives 
-500g pasta (I like the ones that look like clambs for this one because the stuff gets trapped in them, but you can use whatever...maybe not spaghetti) 
-fresh basil and chives (you can also use parsley) 
-olive oil 
-aceto balsamico (if you don't have access to a vegan option, you can use any vegan vinegar just adapt it so it doesn't get too sour)
-salt and pepper


1. While the water is heating up for the pasta you can chop tomatoes, cucumber and black olives into small pieces. Put into bowl. 
2. Put the two peeled garlic cloves together with the pasta into the boiling, salted water. Cook until al dente. It's ok if they still have some bite, it's better than if they are too soft! 
3. Mix olive oil and aceto together. I do half half, but the quantity depends on how much pasta I use. Add some salt and pepper. 
4. Chop the fresh herbs. 
5. When the pasta is ready separate it with a colander from the water. Then you can find the two garlic cloves that should now be soft from cooking and press them into the sauce. Add the still warm pasta to the cut veggies, add the chopped herbs and then pour in the sauce. Mix well and thats it! 


It's super good when it's still warm, but I actually like it  best when it's been in the fridge for a day! I hope this recipe will serve some of you the same way it has served me for many years. Enjoy!",vegan,mywallsaredirty,1567440763,2,True,2019-09-02

Anyone watching Dark Crystal on Netflix? Thoughts on a vegan/vegetarian message in it?,"So this is all just fan theory and having fun, just something to discuss. If you‚Äôre not watching the series yet there may be spoilers here so be careful. I‚Äôll mark them. 

I started thinking about this when I re-watched the original 1982 movie, and now the series has started this theory again. I‚Äôve seen a few people online joke about how the series is referencing climate change (&gt;!via the Darkening!&lt;), and how the Skeksis are politicians in that regard. What I‚Äôm seeing is that the Skeksis are like meat eaters, &gt;!as they consume gelfling and podling essence!&lt;, and the podlings and geflings are vegans, as they eat moss and etc. They are also said to be closest to nature (&gt;!thra!&lt;) and the planet.   


I did a quick search and it turns out Jim Henson was a vegetarian. The Red Book, where Henson wrote his activities, even stated he would ‚Äòmoo‚Äô at non-vegetarians when they ordered beef at dinner. ([source](https://www.henson.com/jimsredbook/2014/09/9-1983-2/))

Raising vegan kids with nonvegan peers?,"Hi there! To preface- I‚Äôm not a bioparent I‚Äôm a stepparent to a kid that wants to be vegan. She‚Äôs almost 8 and very adamantly does not want to eat animals- her dad and I are vegan, her mom is a former vegan (now pescatarian I think?) but is still making her eat chicken and turkey and such at her house, despite not eating it herself. Upsetting, but out of our jurisdiction. So we just keep our diet here and don‚Äôt talk about what she‚Äôs made to eat there unless she wants to talk about it. She wants to be vegan here, (she‚Äôs mostly vegan here already for the past 3 ish years) but still occasionally has snacks with dairy. The older she gets the more passionate about it she becomes! 

Issues we‚Äôre running into- aside from the other parents house/family, her peers are often kind of weird or rude about her not wanting to eat animals. For instance, last year around this time, they went to a pumpkin patch for a field trip. Sounds perfectly vegan friendly! It wasn‚Äôt. Apparently there were pigs on the farm, and a good bit of discussion about bacon. This awesome little girl of ours wasn‚Äôt shy to speak her truth, but was met with much judgment from her peers and no backup from the adults in the situation. That‚Äôs just one example, really..

So I guess, what I‚Äôm asking is, how have you guys helped young aspiring vegan/vegetarians to cope with the world telling them they‚Äôre wrong, in age appropriate ways?  I know young girls in particular are pretty prone to poor relationships with food. I don‚Äôt want her to feel like she has to eat any type of way because of a loyalty bind- I just want to encourage her to be strong about her own decisions.",vegan,literaldingo,1567464034,6,True,2019-09-02

Serious question (to me anyway): biofuels based in part on animal fat,"Hi folks, here is a serious question, at least in my mind: we all know that petro fuels can be seriously bad for the environment.  Many people become vegans for almost the same reason that other people switch to taking the bus or riding a bike instead of driving a car: to reduce environmental impact.  

But what about this?  Suppose we could all switch to biologically-sourced fuels for our cars, trucks, or whatever, BUT ALSO suppose that this biofuel had some animal-based content to it?  

I'm referring to one type of biodiesel that is looking more and more viable as a replacement for petroleum diesel -- similar energy content, but without the potential to wreck rubber hoses and fittings and eat fuel filters -- and that is actually commercially available in increasing quantities.  In addition, they say it is more stable and actually usable in cold climates.  This fuel is called R99, and it's made from a mixture of vegetable oils and animal fats.  

The ethics of biofuels are complicated.  Ideally, vegetable oils would be recycled so as to not impact food availability.  In addition, vegetable-based oils result from plant production, and plants are generally good for the atmosphere.  But animal fat-based fuel?  Or even partially based on animal fats?  

If we quit eating animals (in part) to avoid bad environmental impacts, but it turns out that ONE PART of the animal results in good environmental impacts, does that make it more OK?  What about people (like myself) who consider themselves ethical vegans?  I don't wear any leather because buying leather is part of the economic process of killing animals.  What about driving my work truck using oil that is obtained from the same animals that I didn't want to be killed in the last sentence when it came to my choice of footwear?  

I would love to hear some perspectives, and I'm hoping this may help me figure out how I feel about this.  In the meantime, a couple of interesting links:

Raising chickens as a vegan? (Strange situation),"Hello! I was wondering if there is anyone else caring for a chicken or chickens as a vegan. About 2 months ago, a chicken showed up at my house and I never put out an ad for her because I didn't want to potentially give her back to someone that would harm her. She's been eating the tomatoes and cucumbers I've been throwing out from my garden (she's an awesome gardening buddy!) and I've honestly become a little attached to her. I want to get her a proper coop to roost in at night and a heating lamp before it gets really cold here. My question is, is there anything I could feed her to slow down egg production? I've been looking at food for her and most seem to be geared towards increasing egg production. We do not eat eggs and I plan on feeding them back to her as a treat. She appears to be fairly young and currently roosts in one of our trees. She only stays in our yard and has become accustomed to my husband and I and have started running towards us for food. I worry about predators (we have coyotes and she could get run over by a car if she goes too close to the road) but I think for now, she's going to remain free ranged.

Carnivore here. Want to try again vegan just for science.,"&amp;#x200B;

I eat mostly raw meat, and eggs, from well raised free animals, or grass fed. I also eat occasionally fruits, and very rarely some rice. And thats it. My body does not tolerate anything else.

Everytime i tried a vegan diet my health deteriorated. I believe veganism is good only for some people, and in some situations.

I always lost muscle mass, energy, and got depression. Thats what i can attribute to the lack of animal products in my diet.

But i also got allergic reactions to most vegetables, grains and some fruits. Fruits are good for the most. As for those other issues i dont necessarily blame veganism for it.

So it seems people like me have no other choice than eating meat, if not at least seasonally. But still i want to try it one more time, to see the effect will be the same.

The reason why i want to try it again, is because in the past when i did juicing for a few days, i felt some benefits. But i dont think that can be attributed to veganism, but the fact i was fasting for the most.

However, since i dont tolerate most vegetables. I can only eat rice, and fruits, because everything else will cause terrible symptoms in the short term and illness in the long term. I think that is quite restrictive. But ill see what happens just for a few days.

I would like to know if any of you are as restricted as this? And if you are tell me how have you been doing. Do you work out? How do you feel?",vegan,TheLastMgtow,1567495788,41,True,2019-09-03

Meal ideas for a transitioning family of meat eaters that won't be a shock to the system?,"I'm back on the mission once again after many failed attempts. My plan this time is to change one meal a week to vegan until all animal products are completely weaned out of our diets.

I also have my partner who is not particularly compassionate when it comes to animals, he doesn't want to inflict unnecessary pain (as far as a meat eater can say that) but he doesn't like them even when they're alive, he thinks they're smelly and stupid. And then there's me who really wants to make the change but I always run out of steam a few weeks in.

I'm looking for meals that aren't noticablely lacking in meat, I'm not a fan of fake meats or things that are there as a replacement. So far I can only think of vegetable soups and stews, jacket potatoes and meat free pasta bakes, does anyone have any other ideas?

Today is My Second Veganniversary!,"Two years ago today, after thinking and learning about veganism for years, I took the plunge and have never looked back. Then 50 and diabetic, I made the move for health reasons, in a fit of pique over frustration with my physical well-being. Since that time, owing in no small part to this beautiful community, my heart has grown ever more tender for animals and their well-being and my environmentalism, a long and sustaining commitment, has deepened and broadened.

So two years later, the results have been life-giving and fulfilling. Countless animals have been allowed to live, death-centered industries and enterprises have not been supported, acres have not been cleared and have remained forested. And my health has substantially improved: my diabetes is under much better control than it was before, and I have been able to stop taking all three diabetes pills I used to take. Still insulin-dependent, although that has reduced significantly, above and beyond stopping those pills.

On this anniversary, I commit to increasing my efforts to spread veganism and its ideals and principles and the facts which support it, which are legion. I commit to stepping up my efforts to improve my own health, with the goal of increasing my significant weight loss in hope of becoming ever less diabetic. My body needs that! 

And I commit to reaching within and opening up and being in touch with my feelings, both in the positive and the negative. Owning pain and acknowledging it, embracing love, sharing and celebrating it. And ever being open to learning and expanding awareness and understanding.

Anybody have experience with Airseal vegan boots?,"I'm looking for my first pair of vegan boots.

Bardot fashion brand using animal cruelty and then ignores anyone who points it out.,"Bardot (a fashion brand) had made these tops and dresses using ostrich feathers. Of course people are angry and upset and have called them out. I've used a multiple of different ways, I would of stopped but honestly they refused to reply or address anyone's comments so I just kept commenting hoping they would give in

1. Commented on facebook 2x 
2. Messaged them though facebook (which they saw)

This is what I said 

"" I doubt this will make much of a difference in your CEO's bank account, but I will not be shopping at bardot again due to the ostrich feathers. I know the person answering messages isn't in charge of that, so I do not take it out on them, but I am so disgusted that this was thought of, manufactured and given the approval to go ahead. It's 2019"" 

1. Commented on each of the instagram posts (probably twice each, liked other comments calling them out for animal cruelty  and there's a decent amount of posts advertising these ugly cruel items. I cannot comment on the new ones though as commenting is limited)
2. Tagged them in an instagram story which they have seen 
3. Messaged them on instagram I said 

""Why did you turn off commenting? Is it because you know your choices are unethical and wrong? I know you‚Äôve seen my comments, I know you‚Äôve seen other people comments, you know we are angry but instead of addressing it you continue to ignore. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if you just ignore this or block me""

It's not just me who has shown their disgust and instead of putting out a statement all Bardot does it ignore anyone who points out animal cruelty, limits commenting and continues to advertise these cruel items.

"I want to be vegan again, but struggle gaining weight.","I'm a stay at home mom of a toddler and felt great when I was vegan a couple years ago. 

I strayed when I was anemic (pregnancy related, got infusions, fine now) and since then have only gone downhill. I moved for husband's work but we'll be moving back soon, thank goodness. At my lowest point I've been eating only sugary things and dairy was a huge part of my day because it's just quick calories. Terrible for me, makes me feel bad, I know.

 But with these bad habits I now have silent reflux that's triggered my asthma and I need to fix it before it gets worse. Before I understood what was happening, I'd get shortness of breath that put me in and out of the emergency room. It was awful, especially being the only one caring for my daughter in a foreign country and not being able to do the basics because I couldn't breathe. 

Story aside, I want to get back to veganism again. I'll be back in NYC soon enough and I know it's easier there and I'm excited to feel better; I already do without dairy this past week.

"Joey Graceffa's (YouTuber) ""surprise"" dog pregnancy story seems fishy...","I haven't watched a Joey Graceffa video in years, but one of his puppy videos landed in my recommendations recently which led to me being curious about how the whole situation came about. From what he's told, Lark (mother dog) got impregnated while she was at a doggy daycare facility and they have no idea who the father is. This would mean that Lark was unsupervised with other unfixed dogs for at the least 30 minutes. It seems like a doggy daycare would have to be crazy incompetent for something like this to occur.

Headache after becoming Vegetarian,"Hey, so I recently stopped eating meat and became a vegetarian (I know this is the Vegan reddit) 5 days ago and for some time now I got a consistent headache, that means it doesn't disappear or anything.
I got it 2 days ago and ever since I got it, it didn't disappear, the pain became less so that it doesn't really bother me with my daily activities, but it's still annoying.

I went to a doctor to let it check and he said that I have a cold (which is true my throat hurts aswell) and when I asked if the headach is connected to it he said it's just a migraine.
I didn't tell him that I stoped earing meat, so I decided to ask here if someone made a similar experience.

Another thing that I thought was foolish was that she self snitched on herself and could have potentially got herself and her friends locked the fuck up .

Accidentally bought a vegetarian product instead of vegan. Conflicted about whether to eat it anyway or throw it away.,"Can't really take it back to the store and don't have anyone I can give it to.


Seems silly to just throw out a perfectly good food item, but am also reluctant to eat something containing milk, eggs and whey. (It's strange to feel that way since a couple years ago I wouldn't have given it a second thought.)


I'm wondering if anyone here has any thoughts on the subject.


As for specifics, here in Australia one of our major supermarkets, Coles, has started putting their Christmas puddings out on shelves.


I stopped by on my way home from work to buy some bread and other stuff, and decided to buy a matured Christmas pudding while I was there.


That *specific* type of pudding is vegan, I've bought them a couple of times before. The package even has a very distinctive vegan logo on it. A light-green square with a large dark-green ""V"" on it, and a dark-green stripe along the bottom with the word ""vegan"" on it in small white letters.


But as I was putting it into my basket I noticed a chocolate Christmas pudding next to it, I didn't remember seeing them last year so assumed the must be new. It had exactly the same green ""V"" logo on it as the vegan pudding I was already buying so I thought I'd get that too and give it a try sometime.


It wasn't until after I got home that I noticed that the small white text under the ""V"" said *vegetarian* instead of *vegan*. Looking at the ingredients it has milk eggs and whey.
