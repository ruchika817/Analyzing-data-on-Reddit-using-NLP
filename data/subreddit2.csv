1,Pain from consuming dairy ??,"I’ve been vegetarian for a few months now. I still consume cheese and eggs- I’ve always avoided milk cause it makes me sick. Recently, when I have dairy I get TERRIBLY sick; I wake up in the middle of the night with pain in my stomach and ribs, and I get extremely nauseous. Sometimes the only way to make the pain stop is if I eat bread or something. Has this happened to anyone before? Is it normal at all? Has anyone just went straight vegan cause of problems like this?

19,Why do vegans still attack me for just being vegetarian?,"I dont mean to generalize all vegans, because I've definitely met some vegans who mind their own business. But from my experience a lot of vegans tend to be super rude to me for just being vegetarian. I also have celiac disease and while I understand being a gluten free vegan is possible, its incredibly hard. Being gluten free affects every single aspect of my life, I cant eat out, I cant use products that contain oats or wheat, my boyfriend cant even kiss me after eating something without washing out his mouth first. I also travel a lot, and most countries can barely accommodate celiac on its own, let alone gluten free vegan. I try my hardest to be as ethical as possible, buying free range eggs, refraining from eating a lot of dairy, mostly I just eat cheese and nothing else as I'm also lactose intolerant, avoiding single use plastic the best I can, avoiding palm oil, and even with me trying this hard people still attack me for not being vegan. I just find the holier-than-thou attitude a turn off and lot of vegans have this attitude, showing little to no empathy towards people and their situations. Not everybody can afford to be vegan, not everybody has the health to be vegan, here are cultural differences we must respect as well. I just dont understand why its such a judgmental community, not to mention a lot of people hate vegan culture for this reason. Being kind and empathetic would have a better affect on people who eat meat. Plus vegetarians arent the enemy, were still doing more to help animal welfare than most people. I just dont understand it and I find it frustrating and depressing that two very similar groups of people fighting for most of the same things cant get along.

I've known deep down for a long time that consuming animals is wrong, and I've cut out most meat except fish and chicken. I stay in denial and keep buying chicken because I literally eat it every day.

I suspect I have IBS and eating chicken and rice everyday is the only way my stomach feels normal. Vegetables just taste bad to me (but I know that's juvenile and I need to suck it up). I'll eat vegetables and pretend I like them to try and force myself into it. I also struggle with obesity, so I already have bad eating habits. I ALSO have PCOS, and the only time I've lost weight is with a low carb, low calorie diet, which makes beans and lentils less of an option. 

I eat the same chicken dish every. single. day, and I have no idea how to replace it. I marinade the meat in saffron, lemon juice, turmeric, and olive oil. Is there anything vegetarian I can get the same saffron-y taste with?

45,Low - prep meals/advice,"Hi all, bit of backstory before my question.

I'm a college student living at home, I love the idea of being vegetarian, and was for a while a few years ago. But I found myself eating nothing substantial (just lots of pasta) for a very long while and switched back for the sake of my health. 

After some thought, I concluded that my diet got so bad due to a lack of time to prep the meals I knew how to make. Both before and after my time without meat, I would just throw things together last second, and it worked out fine (any meat grilled with some seasonings is a good dinner to me). So I found it a great challenge to prep my food ahead of time, espicially with the schedule semesters present to me. 

I'm wondering if you all have any methods/recipies/advice regarding reducing meal prep time. Only food I adamently refuse to eat is eggplant, all others welcome.

He then went on to say giving the dead animal money is honoring them so they don’t go to waste. 

My argument was I don’t care giving my dollar still gives the industry money and power to continue what they’re doing and not just “honoring” a dead animal, whatever that means...

Then he said none of us vegetarians/vegans matter we are nobody and the meat industry will always be powerful and I’m already frustrated enough being a waitress and I really didn’t need to be having this conversation so I just stayed quiet.

78,Honest questions from a former vegetarian,"I started out as a ""reducatarian"" a few years ago. As a I learnt more about animal welfare, how animal agriculture affects climate, and the health benefits of replacing animal sourced foods with plant base options, I became vegetarian and last year made the jump to vegan.

With all the infighting and puritanical screaming at each other that goes around online, I took me all year to be able to confidently say: ""I'm vegan."". I see a lot of negative parallels with the hardcore religious people I was surrounded by growing up. (Where all answers are in black and white an no grey area's exists.)

Eventually I made the conclusion for myself that it wasn't about being at a certain level but about learning, growing, educating myself and changing my habits and actions accordingly. And this is where my question comes into play. Having grown up on and surrounded by dairy farms it was kind of a shock to start understanding what really goes on. But once I came to that realization it was fairly easy to let go of dairy based products. My question to you is (if applicable): How do you deal with this knowledge and not work towards eliminating animal sourced products.

101,Frustrations as a vegetarian?,"Let me start by saying I am not a vegetarian. However, I do tend to tend to go for vegetarian options when available. I do not like most meats due to taste, texture, and/or appearance reasons. As I have been sorta dabbling with a primarily veggie diet, I have noticed more people reacting or judging what I like and it is a bit frustrating. 

&amp;#x200B;

For instance, I travel in a group for work and it is common for us to stop at food outlets. I usually aim for vegetarian options, especially since I do not like being too filled up for a manual labor job. Almost every time I order a vegetarian option, my coworkers with something along the lines of ""Eww,"" or ""That is gross."" Usually something that is a more-so negative 2-cents of theirs. This is also common during events like parties and family functions.

Whenever I'm with family, the same thing happens. On one hand, it is kinda worse because I still eat with my family at the table; do not get to pick what is being served. I often find myself having to eat meats I am not to fond of, or picking things out like bacon-bits and whatnot. It happens in social situations such as parties too, and I feel guilty for not accepting food offers. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel as if a lot of people assume what you like, and sometimes even display some type of repulse. It is a pet peeve of mine when I am offered food, politely turn it down, get asked why I declined, mention that it is not for me, and get a some kinda condescending response. For example, I cannot stand hot dogs or bacon and it is very common to see them around at parties. I feel like people insist to eat it but refuse to believe what I actually like, even after telling them several times. As if my tastebuds have magically changed overnight.

116,Is there such a thing as too much soy?,"So I've been cutting down on meat for the past 6 months and have decided to become completely vegetarian for 2020.

However I'm kind of worried that my diet may not be healthy as I eat tofu for almost every meal as it's the easiest thing for me to cook with the limited space in my home.

A normal day for me would be.

Breakfast: 2 eggs and 2 egg whites

Lunch: 200 grams tofu 1/2 ton kidney beans 250 grams mixed veg

Dinner: 200 grams tofu 1/2 ton kidney beans 250 grams mixed veg

Snacks: 1 liter soy milk, 64 grams whey, 30 grams popcorn

This is what I normally eat on the days I'm in work as I do 14 hour shifts and cant do meal prep so all I have to work with really is a microwave and a george Forman and in all honesty I dont get board eating just this.

117,Why is soy milk so controversial?,"It's been around the longest of all the plant milk alternatives. I remember being a kid and soya (I'm UK) milk was the only one you could buy. I've been a fan of soya milk for a long time, and probably switched over to non-dairy milk entirely four of so years ago. As far as I'm concerned, soya still holds the top spot (joint with oat milk) for simply tasting the best all round - to me it's traditionally been the only one that tastes 'right' in a cup of tea for example, striking the right balance between sweetness and creaminess. If you're:

A. British
B. Used to drinking tea with dairy milk

Then you're probably familiar with how a traditional cup of tea 'should' taste. Now I can't speak for everyone but certain milks just taste plain wrong to me in tea: almond generally doesn't taste sweet, or creamy enough, and doesn't mimic the flavour of real milk closely - hazelnut is creamy, but again not sweet enough, and has an odd flavour profile for tea - coconut milk just tastes plain *wrong* and is my least favourite. I can leave rice milk and hemp milk. I love cashew milk, however, and it's also probably the most similar-looking alternative to the real thing.

What are your thoughts on soya milk, and why is it that so many people I talk to in real life have an opposition to it? I will say...I understand that soya is, not the friendliest product to the environment. Despite this though. the inexpensive price, and taste profile of soya milk, make it my go-to.",vegetarian,ChurKirby,1577895790,15,True,2020-01-01

Tonight I ordered takeaway pasta with my family  as we always do on Wednesday nights. The pasta I usually get is vegetarian but has the extra option of adding chicken for meat eaters. I ordered over the phone and when the food arrived my pasta had chicken in it. By coincidence the pasta my mother ordered was vegetarian so I asked if she would be willing to switch with me. She has ordered my pasta with the chicken before and enjoyed it so it wasn’t something completely outlandish. Alternatively I offered to make myself something else seeing as I didn’t want her to feel obligated to accommodate me.

She told me to just pick out the chicken from my pasta and couldn’t understand why I refused to do that. She told me that me and my “nonsense” (vegetarianism) are making life difficult for everyone around me and that I was being selfish. She then made me switch with her and ate almost nothing. 

Am I wrong for not compromising my values?

Tl;dr of previous post is that my daughter wanted to challenge herself to a year of pescatarianism.  

Well, today is officially a full year. She freaking did it. Not a single (knowing) slip up. She went an entire year without eating meat just because she wanted to see if she could. I shouldn’t be a surprised as I am since I know she’s a hard headed, strong willed young woman. But I’m still blown away. 

A few notes about the year. 

- The biggest thing is how much my grocery budget has shrunk. Meat is fucking expensive. Vegetables are not nearly as costly and it *really* helps even more when you grow your own (/#blessed). 

- My two teenage boys haven’t missed it at all. They aren’t pescatarian and eat meat when they want it (at school, when we go out to eat, etc). They give her a hard time but that is more being siblings that tease each other than actually having any negative feelings toward it. 

- At about 6 months in, we did start using/experimenting with some meat analogs. That was about the time we had an Impossible Burger the first time. That thing is a-maz-ing. We had it at Busch Gardens and when she first bit into it, she started crying because she thought she’d accidentally been given a ground beef burger and was incredibly upset. I took a bite and almost went full Karen (or whatever the dude version of Karen is). I honestly prefer that to regular burger now partly because I don’t feel gross after eating it. 

- Our meals have become a lot more creative. We have always eaten well (I was a chef for 25 years before changing careers). But it was easy to fall into the work week routine of making the same dishes over and over. We did have some nights where we scrapped the meal and ordered pizza because I screwed it up, we didn’t care for it, or something like that. But overall we have had a lot of fun experimenting. 

- (This is probably preaching to the choir) I was absolutely blown away at the quality of vegetarian offerings at grocery stores. There is so much great stuff out there! 

- (This is *definitely* preaching to the choir) There are some truly shitty people out there. I have had to jump dead in some strangers asses (and a family member) for berating a 15/16 year old child for her dietary choices. Like, seriously, What. The. Fuck?! Our dietary choices are absolutely none of your fucking business. They don’t affect you in any way. She is *obviously* healthy, active, and all of her nutritional needs are being met. Her doctor recommended a multivitamin but is incredibly happy with all 3 of the kids health. Who the fuck do these people think they are and where the fuck do they get off talking to *children* like that?!

- I didn’t make any announcements or anything but 90% of Thanksgiving and Christmas meals were vegetarian. We had 10 quite committed and vocal carnivores over and they cleaned up. Said it was the best food they’d had. Imagine their Shocked Pikachu  face when I told them the only things that had meat in them was the turkey and ham. /#winning

It’s been a great year. I’ve asked her if she’s going to revert back but she isn’t inclined to at this point. She has (well founded) concerns about getting sick after not eating meat for so long and said the only things she really misses is bacon and turkey at the holidays. We experimented with the veggie roasts and stuff but we just aren’t fans (one of the meals that went in the trash).

151,Vegetarian uni meals,"Hi all, 
I’m going to be attending my second year of university this year and am a little lost on what meals to cook/make for lunch and dinner. I will have a budget of $20-30 each week and will mostly be focusing on vegetables &amp; fruits. A local vegetable shop provides free delivery at an affordable price within my budget so I’m going to take full advantage of that. 

These are some vegetables and fruits that I like to consume ~
• Vegetables: Potato, celery, tomato, carrot, capsicum and peppers, green onion, broccoli, cucumber, red onions, spinach 
* Fruits: I like all fruits and am happy with any type of fruit that is available 

Other than fruits/vegetables I also intend to shop at my local supermarket for rice, nacho chips, cheese, and other foods that I like that would take too long to mention here fully. 

So anyways, I was wondering if anyone on this sub has some good recipes for focusing solely on vegetables. (Additions can include rice and other affordable foods for a student)

Something that is appealing to me is vegetable stirfry but I don’t want to make that every single day. 

I’m also thinking about setting aside one day of the week for meal prepping and chopping up my vegetables and storing them in the freezer for use immediately as the week goes on. 
So meal prep tips and the appropriate storing methods of the vegetables I mentioned above would be much appreciated:)

I am exclusively plant-based at home but if I’m out and I order a veggie burger I don’t feel the need to ask for an ingredients list and interrogate or waiter or cashier about the bun. If my french fries are fried in the same fryer as meat sometimes there’s nothing I can really do about it. I don’t like it but I know for a fact that things like this happen in the restaurant world. Or if I get spaghetti with tomato sauce and no cheese and it comes with garlic bread I don’t see any purpose of me throwing out the garlic bread because it may be prepared with a small amount of whey. ( it’s my experience that most restaurant garlic bread is made with garlic flavored shortening instead of butter because it’s more cost-effective.) i’m not always super strict about reading labels or ingredients.

209,I tried Beyond Meat sausage at Hardee's - They scraped the grills.,"I know this is anecdotal and will only concern certain peoples but as I was waiting for my meal (I ordered a Frisco Breakfast Sandwich with Beyond Sausage instead of ham) I overheard the kitchen manager instructing her staff on the preparation of the sausage. One of the things that stood out was she was telling a story of a friend of hers that had the Impossible Burger at Burger King the other day and became sick. She said the reason was that her friend was allergic to meat and the Impossible Burger had flecks of meat from the grill on the sandwich which in turn made her sick when she unknowingly ate them. She then told her staff, ""...and this is why they said to make sure to thoroughly scrape the grill clean before you cook the Beyond Sausage, and use the designated spatula.""

The kitchen didn't know I could hear them from the counter but I asked the cashier when she brought me my food to please let the manager know that I overheard what she said and I thank her for being so considerate.

Can I pick r/vegetarian's brains on some things?,"TLDR: have to cut out all nuts, soy produce, most dairy, most yeast preparations. Can't eat Quorn. What are my options for the protein/satisfying part of my meal?

DISCLAIMER: Not a vegetarian. Over half my meals are in line with a lacto-ovo vegetarian diet anyway though, so I'm not a 'peel my cold dead fingers off mah burger' person.

This morning I was handed a list of foods during an health appointment. I need to eliminate them all for 3 months and then introduce them back one at a time. The person I saw was not a dietician so they weren't able to help with any meal planning. After being told to research the diet to work out more detailed information (like 'nuts' was listed. Is that all nuts? Tree nuts? Ground nuts? Turns out it was ALL nuts, peanuts and sesame seeds too😭) I've worked out I'm being asked to have a low Tryamine diet. 

I am really struggling for 'main' elements for dishes. I can have lean, unprocessed meat but it's expensive and boring/annoying to cook all the time. I used to eat a fair amount of soya mince, soya meat etc. I'd eat Quorn but it gives me diarrhea. 

The only thing I can think of to use is pulses. I'm just struggling to come up with a variety of things to eat, that I can cook while herding rambunctious children and aren't difficult to get hold of. I need to get in as much variety as possible as other people I cook for easily go off of food for aaaaages after I've cooked it too much. I was working on a 3 week meal plan with no repeats.

213,Eating at BK in the US,"How to use ""Whopper"" coupons:

You probably know that Burger King has 2 veg sandwich options. There is the original, a healthy-ish Morning Star Farms garden veggie patty, and then of course, the delicious but maybe less healthy(?) Impossible Whopper.

My story- when receiving BK coupon mailers. I began asking to sub the original Whopper for the Impossible at the store. Initially, this worked and I was very happy. Then they started up charging me a dollar for each Impossible Whopper sometimes. I felt like there was poor training of employees around the subject so each did things differently. Eventually though, my local stores entirely stopped accepting the coupons because ""it says right on the coupon, no substitutions (true) and we were trained not to accept these for use on Impossible Whopper"". I asked if they could be used on the original veggie burger and was told ""no"".

My most recent visit, I asked if the coupons were totally useless to a vegetarian and was told basically, yes. Their veggie burger was nowhere to be found on the menu but I asked about the old veggie burger. Apparently it's called the ""Veggie Whopper"" now and when I heard that I asked ""can I use..."" the whopper coupon for a ""veggie whopper""? 

The answer is YES, you can use Whopper coupons on the ""veggie whopper""s. Just make sure you call it that, because again, it is obvious their training on such issues wasn't thorough for all employees.

245,Was fed meat at a restaurant without knowing - Advice needed,"Hi, I just joined this community to make this post. I didn’t know it existed until now honestly, I don’t use reddit often, but I need advice.

I have been vegetarian for over three years. My family eats meat. We are all currently on vacation in Hawaii and have been here for about seven days.

I am vegetarian because of the ethics. I think it is wrong to eat animals. I understand that this is not a shared belief by a lot of people, but I strongly believe this.

On day one of my vacation, we went to a nearby ramen place to our hotel. On their menu, they had a miso vegetable ramen that looked good so we decided to go in. My family always eats somewhere where there are options for me, because we like to go and eat places together. 

We go in and ask the waitress if the miso vegetable ramen was vegetarian, and she said it had a pork broth. I said ok, that’s okay I can just not eat/get sides. The waitress then says that they have a new tomato ramen that had a tomato soup base without meat. I try it and it was great. 

Tonight, my family decided to go back because we thought it was good the last time. I order the tomato ramen again and double check that it is vegetarian, and turns out it was beef based.

When I found this out, I have a complete breakdown in the restaurant. I couldn’t help myself from crying and I start having a panic attack where I couldn’t feel my arms or legs. Other people in the restaurant started looking and the people sitting next to us tried to comfort me but I just couldn’t stop from crying. 

The waitress lectures me about how I should know Japanese ramen is never vegetarian. My family started arguing with the staff on my behalf saying that the waitress that first day said explicitly that there was no meat in the broth. 

We left the restaurant for the hotel and I have been crying the whole way over. I am currently in the bathroom crying. 

I’m thinking myself in circles right now. I have felt bloated and sick (acid reflux) all week even though I don’t have a history of acid reflux. I am typically pretty skinny and my stomach has been sticking out looking like I am pregnant for a whole week now. I can’t help but think this is why. 

I need help coping. Beef is the animal I feel the most strongly about ethics-wise. I need help calming down and figuring out what to do next. Although my family is trying to comfort me they don’t understand what it’s like. I need advice from other vegetarians. 

Tl;dr Was fed beef broth when I was told it was vegetarian. Found out when I went back a week later. I am having trouble coping and need advice.",vegetarian,helpmethrow-awayyyyy,1578126030,30,True,2020-01-04
246,I told my parents that I'm going vegetarian and I think they think lower of me now. I'm devastated.,"So I've been living almost as a vegetarian for about a year and a half by now. The only occasion that I ate meat was when we were eating out or when I was at my parents or grandparents. But recently I cut out all meat and I was feeling great, and I was really proud of me for once.

Then came the holidays and with it loads and loads of food. My dad and my grandfather love cooking and they always cook with meat. I honestly think they've never eaten a vegetarian meal in their lives. They always say that they can't eat salad or raw vegetables because they mess up their digestion, so the side dishes are mostly cooked potatoes or cauliflower with bacon or something. So of course, this holidays, as always, there's meat with meat with meat with a side of meat. And being a good and polite child I of course at it. But my stomach wasn't too happy about it. I had cramps almost everyday during that time and I felt really bad and ashamed for some reason. I despised myself for every bite I took. But I didn't want to offend my family by not eating.

After the holidays I got to think about whether I wanted to carry on like this or just go full vegetarian and tell my parents. It was a really hard decision because since I can remember my family never thought highly about vegans and vegetarians, mocking and being disrespectful towards their lifestyle. Being like ""why buy products that taste like meat when you are vegetarian. If you crave it that bad just buy a peace of nice pig!"" or (during dinner) ""thank God that we never had one of the girls bring home a vegetarian that would ruin this lovely meal for us"". And I just sat there in silence not saying anything.

So fast forward to yesterday. I told my mom that I would like to go full vegetarian, and she was somewhat respectful of my decision (but I never worried about her, she's always been really supportive, my main concern was my father who lives for meat), maybe voicing some concerns about malnutrition, but I explained to her that that isn't a problem anymore in this time and age so she was like ""whatever, if it makes you happy"". I told her not to tell my dad because I wasn't ready yet but she did anyways, but she only told me that she did this morning. Looking back, he actually made something for dinner yesterday that we both could enjoy (that meat was separated from the other stuff so I could actually eat something.

So I took my odds and confronted my dad. It was really really hard for me because I've been struggling to get his approval all my life, and with this decision I think I never will. I told him that I wanted to live as a vegetarian for health reasons, as well as ethical and environmental. I could already see the disapproval in his eyes so I added ""maybe I'll eat meat when I'm here over the weekend every other month, but I can't tell yet for sure"". He told me that he didn't approve of my decision, saying that living vegetarian is not environmentally above eating meat because of the pollution during transport (we live in Europe so somewhat of a fail point if I was to eat mangos everyday) and that being vegetarian isn't a lifestyle for him but political extremism. Like being a far right extremist. And that he only eats meat from animals that have lived ""happily"" and that I could do the same. He told me being vegetarian for ethical reasons would be jumping the bandwagon because of all the environmental extremism going on right now and that I don't think myself if I do it.

So yeah. I mean I am studying biology and am really environmentally conscious, but I really don't see his point. So it tried calming him down saying I'm not trying to change his lifestyle, it's only something I'm doing for myself, and that he can continue cooking whatever he pleases as long as there's maybe a side without meat.

That was the end of the conversation, because my mom walked into the room and we just stopped talking. I really don't know what to do, I know he doesn't approve of my decision. Has anyone had a similar experience and know some sort of way to make him understand?

Sorry for the long post and the rambling, I just had to get it of my mind and thought some of you might have some advice. Also sorry for typos or grammatical errors in general, English is not my primary language.

Thank you for any advice!

Edit: thank all of you for your kind advice! I see now that (as u/GhostGecko2 suggested) there's no point in trying to ""make him understand"" because he is entitled to an opinion on this matter as much as I am.

282,I’m a self proclaimed vegetarian but I’ll eat meat on special occasions. My family and some friends give me shit for it - how do you deal?,"**ETA I don’t flaunt that I’m veg, it’s just known about me to my family and friends** 

So I recently went back to being veg after taking a year ish break (prior to this I was veg for a year). I avoid meat for purely environmental reasons, and honestly I don’t really care about the animal welfare side of things. Call me a bad person, whatever. My choice. Anyway. 

Because of my reasons for going veg in the first place I allow myself a treat every now and then. For example, if I’m at a specialty restaurant and I’m not a fan of their vegetarian option. Like this restaurant I just went to that had AMAZING reviews for their Cuban sandwich only had a portobello mushroom thing as a vegetarian option. I hate portobellos and I didn’t want to eat fries and a side veggie, so I let myself have the Cuban sandwich. It was great! I also had some fish meals because I’m on a trip to key west so of course the fish is prime. 

I’m entirely content with my choices and I feel zero guilt from myself. However, my family seems to like to point out every time I eat meat. “Oh yea, issajulia the vegetarian is having meat now huh??” and they just make me feel guilty for it. I’ve explained my rationale. I’ve asked them to stop. But they just like to pick on me so much about it and it’s wearing me down. I don’t want to sulk with a meal I don’t even like or my sixth veggie burger of the last 4 days just so I don’t have to deal with them. Rarely my friends will also make comments about when I eat meat. 

Is there something more effective I should be saying to get them to stop, or am i doomed to resorting to ignoring them? I used to have an eating disorder and am still a bit sensitive so I try to be careful about maintaining a healthy, guilt free attitude about my food choices but I’m feeling like I’m at the end of my rope with all the unsolicited comments",vegetarian,issajulia,1578181470,31,True,2020-01-04

I'm a pescaterian and have been for a couple of months. It's going pretty easy for me at the minute but I'm taking things slow. I've switched before and gone full vegan or vegetarian and kind of hit a wall both times so I'm doing it less gung ho this time around.

But my post isn't about that.

I'm a part of a couple of chat groups, one of which started talking about vegetarianism and it's impact on the world. If it really matters if we all switch from a meat based diet to a plant based. One of my friends works for a company that's deep in the food industry, with machinery and such.

He had a couple of interesting points that I just have to admit that I can't refute since I don't have any reference or knowledge to do so. So if it's okay (and I know some of you have probably answered this in your own life or on here before but bare with me) I'd like to pass some of his points along:

&amp;#x200B;

1. If everybody would switch to a plant based diet the carbon emissions world wide would only be lowered by aprox 2,5%. That included everything, farm land, animal food etc.
2. That would mean that 1/2 of the lowest 1/4 of the population would lose their jobs.
3. That's why no African country has any interest in ""printing food"", i.e. producing clean meat or high protein veggie products. The land is too valuable.
4. 80% of the lowest income people work in agriculture, he guessed that about 90% of that focused on animal proteins.
5. The land or products produced for animals are in large parts not suitable for human consumption.

Heard also that in normal amount the effects are close to none noticeable.

And once they stopped and surgically removed the gynecomastia the problem did not return. (This was from eating chicken with lots of soy sauce according to victim)

This post is of course not a post to berate vegetarians. I personally believe a vegan diet can and is healthy in many ways. Of course this does not mean it doesn’t have any flaws. The reason for making this post was because of a friend telling me it does not increase estrogen because it was not the same type of estrogen as in our body’s. (If i remember correctly it was something along those lines). I said i was scared to eat soy foods because it increases estrogen.

450,Meat cravings &amp; flexitarianism,"Firstly, I don’t mean to trigger or offend anyone with this post, I just need some advice and/or guidance and/or support. 

Being a “flexitarian” or semi-vegetarian is a contested subject, but I believe it to be a good starting ground to eventually becoming a fully fledged vegetarian - giving up meat products cold turkey (lol at that saying in this context) is not easy for everyone. 

Initially I was a flexitarian only eating a meat product once maybe twice a month, but otherwise eating fully vegetarian for the rest of the time. This was for maybe roughly 6 months before I became fully vegetarian for the past 6 months. 

_The problem comes in now_: after the last 6 months of being fully vegetarian I am having __insane__ meat cravings. I’m struggling to resist the idea of going back to being a flexitarian. I’m struggling with the discipline of not consuming a meat product at the moment. The cravings are there, the thoughts are there, the temptation to give in is there. Sometimes I just want that burger or pizza. This is a month long thing and isn’t going away :/

Help! What do I do? Temporarily return to being a flexitarian? Satisfy the craving and return to normal? Has anyone else experienced this and if so how did you handle it? Waiting it out doesn’t seem to be working. 

I’m swaying towards the thought/idea that I should maybe give the flexitarian thing a chance again and then eventually move back to vegetarianism again - thoughts on this?

_Side note_: I chose a vegetarian lifestyle for environmental reasons, as well as for my beliefs and love for animals (I’m not sure what the right way to phrase it is). The guilt is there, this is conflicting :/

So...this is a bit far off, but I'm thinking about it now because my grandmother just sent me the itinerary for the trip. I am going to Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Italy for three and a half weeks this Summer with six people: my grandparents, two sisters, and two cousins. They are all omnis.

I am a brand new vegetarian who feels very strongly about not eating meat. I also can see the horrible things in the rest of the animal industry and am switching to vegan beauty and clothing products. I am also planning to try to do my next semester of college completely vegan.

However, my anxiety is sky high about this trip. I am very excited to go and learn about my roots from my grandparents, but my grandma especially just thinks that this is a phase and has already asked me if I would be okay with eating some meat on this trip. My mom talked her down from this by comparing what she asked me to do to her asking a recovering alcoholic to just drink a little alcohol. You wouldn't do that. She stopped pushing me on it after that, but they're not going to try and accommodate me and pick places with options. I have used happy cow and am relieved to see that at least all the major cities we are going to have plenty of vegan options. But I am worried about what to eat at relatives houses and in small towns.

Had anyone navigated something similar to this before? How did you cope and find things to eat without starving or breaking your values? I'm so new at this right now that I'm terrified that I might give in, which I don't want to do.

31,How do you feel about bonded leather upholstery?,"I've been trying to research it but am having trouble finding much information or discussion about it.

It's apparently made by shredding the leather scraps left over after most of a hide is used for genuine leather products, or possibly sometimes from recycled used leather products (unclear how often this is the case). Then it is layered with plastic/resin to make basically a leather equivalent to plywood. I've read various figures for how much actual leather is in bonded leather, but it seems to be between 10-20%.

Ethically speaking, I understand genuine leather isn't really a byproduct of the meat industry, and I avoid that. But is bonded leather just a byproduct of the leather industry, since it assures scrap/leftover leather isn't just trashed? Or does buying bonded leather products substantially increase the demand for/price of leather overall and thereby increase cow deaths &amp; suffering? How much does the value of leftover leather scraps contribute to the overall value of a hide? Would getting rid of bonded leather entirely improve the situation for cows at all, or would they be still be slaughtered in equal numbers for the genuine leather? I can't figure out where to even start looking for actual numbers.

I'm also not at all clear on how relatively bad it is for the environment, compared to other materials.

I ask because I'm trying to decide if I can buy a chair containing bonded leather or not, since I hate mesh chairs (back pain), and fabric chairs that fit me seem to be basically non-existent at affordable prices, and my back is killing me. I've been trying to find a used chair for ages, but my local thrift stores are always picked over. The only chair I've found that actually fits me and seems like it might help my back pain is made with fabric and bonded leather, and I'm feeling like buying this chair would help my health considerably, and that it's maybe less ethically questionable than my consumption of dairy, but I'm conflicted and aware that I might be biased in favor of convincing myself it's acceptably ethical because that would benefit me.

We would like to extend our heartfelt gratitude to everyone who participated in our user survey. The turnout was higher than we could have ever hoped for. Thank you for sharing how you live. Many of the questions we asked were very personal, we value the trust you place in us.

In the three weeks that polling was open, we received 1,779 responses. On 197,700 subscribers, that’s 0.9%. Of course, not all respondents are subscribed to Veggit, but we have a good sample size. We’re grateful that the survey was not cross-posted to other subreddits and we did not see any evidence of brigading from other subreddits.

We plan to publish the survey results when Veggit hits 200k subscribers, to celebrate the occasion. At the current growth rate, that will take about a week. So we’ll do our utmost to have the results ready by then.

What I came here to ask is, if you are vegetarian for ethical reasons, why do you think vegetarianism and not veganism is the way to go?

Animals are killed in the egg and dairy industries too. You have the killing of calves, and dairy cows once they're too old, as well as male chicks, which in the egg industry are considered byproducts.

1. I understand the power of green leaf plants and Brassicaceae plants, therefore I will incorporate a lot of those **(40%)** in my main meal diet;
2. Other plants like mushroom, ginger, onions, carrots, tomatoes, etc, would make (**30%**) of my main meal diet;
3. I also trim down carb with high Glycemic index in my main meal diet like rice and noodles, I will make these starch-based food (10%) in my main meal diet;
4. I love eating seafood and eggs (4-5 per day) so they would be (15%) in my main meal diet;
5. My family eats meat, but they believe similar theory I believe -- eat far more plants than meat, therefore the (5%) will be terrestrial animal meat in my main meal diet;
6. I don't like eating beans or Tofu, I know it's weird since I am Asian. I also dislike them and nuts because they are a hassle to deal with, they need to be processed to remove all the enzymes, oxalic acid, phytic acids or tannins. So they cannot be a part of my main meal diet.

I don't really eat much animal sourced products outside of my main meal, 

I love eating fruits and avocado for after meal desserts:

I take some supplements:

Just looking for some help and I figured this would be a good place to start. Earlier this year, I was living in student accommodation and a lot of the meals I prepared were vegetarian. It was partly due to how much it was cheaper to go vegetarian, while also living with a bunch of other vegetarians/vegans.

However, I recently watched 'The Game Changers' on Netflix and would love to pick up on easing back into a vegetarian diet. I've also convinced my family to try it for a week! 

The problem is that my meals lacked variety, namely due to student budget and also not having the best kitchen appliances for more adventurous meals. So, I would eat the same thing for weeks on end. It wasn't a problem for me, but I feel like if I want to my family to enjoy the beauties of going vegetarian, I should have at least some variety to offer. I was wondering if you guys have any recommendations on what meals/recipes I could easily prepare?

123,My sibling is newly veggie/vegan and I want to support him but also address his mental health. They're intertwined. Help?,"I love my brother so much. I think it is great that he is a new vegan. But this has come about at a time when he is really struggling with his mental health and a breakup, and I am trying to figure out how to support his dietary choices while advocating that he get help for his current mental health needs. 

If anyone went through a similar thing on your journey  your comments would be appreciated. 

1. He is struggling with self harm. I saw clear evidence of this the other night. From what he has said to our parents it is partly due to a recent rough breakup but also due to guilt for having eaten meat and sadness for the animals still dying. This is an EXTREMELY concerning factor and my family just seems to think he is worried about the animals rather than taking the self harm seriously.   
2. Similar vein, the other day (we were visiting family) he was sobbing to a family member about the suffering of the animals. I support the vegetarianism for the ethical reasons... but I think my family has blinders on about how significantly abnormal this reaction is? Did you all encounter similar feelings? Did you cry about these animals when you first stopped eating them?   
3. From a self care perspective, he is now vegan but is not eating in such a way that he can forgo vitamins and is not taking them at all. He doesn't seem to think this is a big problem. My family thinks he will figure it out. I think it can not be good for his already-poor mental health.   

4. I'm vegetarian a few days each week. I'm working to reduce overall animal consumption and to get what I do eat locally/sustainably. My point is, I'm not an idiot nor am I unsympathetic. This is not good enough for him. He insists that he is morally superior (and on telling me so) because my life habits kill animals. I can concede that. But in the same conversation where I'm applauding his choices, he tells me that: me saying I don't mind supporting my local farmers and buying their meat is the same as people supporting slavery in the south for the sake of the farmers, tells me that my drinking milk is evil and showing me videos of abused cows, and calling me a ""typical omni"" (those words) when I expressed that I felt sustainable meat eating was an okay goal as we are naturally omnivores (which you might disagree on, and that's fine!).
My problem is, I tried to stop the conversation several times and he would bring things back up or engage again. 

And look, I'm aware that he is not in a great mental state right now so I don't care if he wants to attack me and my life choices a little. I can take that. I am worried because the way he is going about these points... arguing, accusing, and insulting-- has already started to alienate other friends and family. Even folks that are vegetarians don't like how he is treating others about it.


My family is indulging him and I feel like I'm the only one who is MOSTLY just worried about his mental health. But it is so intertwined with his newfound vegan lifestyle that any voiced concerns about his current state are drowned out by ""He is just worried about the animals.""

I’ve never been a big milk drinker, so large amounts of dairy has always kind of irritated my stomach. Recently, i’ve made the switch to strictly Oatmilk in place of just about everything that normal milk would be used. 
   
   Since then, i’ve noticed that cheese (which, unless in large amounts, never used to hurt my stomach) has started to make my stomach pretty upset. I figured that was normal since I have recently cut out milk almost entirely. 

  However, i was quite surprised when, after eating an egg last night, things went pretty south pretty fast (literally). 

   I’ve never experienced stomach pain quite like this before, my stomach is very upset and it hasn’t stopped being upset since I ate ONE EGG last night , this may be TMI but nothing is passing, however, my stomach is in knots. 

   Is this purely because of my vegetarian diet?? Does this happen to all vegetarians over time?? Should I just go vegan at this point?? Has this happened to any of you? Please help me, I love cheese.

216,University Christmas meat-based lunch: to go or not to go?,"I've been vegetarian for over a year. I've had my slipups, but because I didn't properly check the ingredients list/done my research, not because of cravings. In fact, I don't miss meat/fish at all. I've never been a huge fan of these foods, so it's been fairly easy so far.

However, in my university, there's a tradition: the oldest students prepare a Christmas lunch for the new ones (including me), to spend time together and get to know each other (our course is very small, less than 20 people per year). It's a great idea and I'd love to participate. The problem is that they'll be cooking traditional meals of my area, which revolve around meat. There isn't a single dish that's meatless. I'm the only vegetarian in the class and I'm not in the position to ask for a special menu. Furthermore, everyone in my class will be there, and I don't want to miss out on something.

What I'm asking is: is it wrong if I eat those heavily meat-based dishes? Especially if I don't really like the taste either? I always preach flexibility, that what matters is what you do 90% of the time, not on occasion, but it feels wrong to eat meat, considering that I absolutely don't need it for health reasons, nor I like it. At the same time it feels wrong to be the only one who doesn't participate. And no, going there without eating isn't an option.. Finally, could I get sick?

I feel so awful and I know it wasn’t my fault that the order was wrong but I feel like I still screwed up by finishing it.

First thing I noticed was that they fall apart a lot easier than normal meat. Wasnt very much of a detriment just had to handle them more carefully.

I had to salt them quite a lot. The first one I didnt salt all that much an thus had almost no taste. Something that I did not notice but my mother did was the smell while grilling them. My mother is a criminal investigator and according to her it smelled just like a burn victim. 

The taste was good. I did a direct comparison to real meat with a patty I made myself and I did notice a few differences. They were not worse or better just slightly different. I could probably notice now that I know how it tastes, I likely wouldnt have noticed before.

The texture, arguably the most important part about meat was really good. It wasnt quite as bitey as real meat, which is not necessarily bad. The burger was also juicier than real meat which was better.

I also tested it on my (very picky) older sister who I did not tell it was fake meat. She did not notice a difference and said it tasted good. On telling her it was vegetarian she eyed it suspiciously but ate the rest.

All in all I can definitely recommend it as a fake meat. I personally will probably not buy all that many. Simply because I can make burgers of the same taste for 1/4 of the money and my moral compass isnt strong enough to be vegetarian.",vegetarian,Mad_Maddin,1575744130,4,True,2019-12-07

I’m considering going veggie, but since it’s a pretty big diet change I want to do it slowly (start with meatless monday, move on to only meat on Sunday etc.)

BUT her long term partner is 100% meat. He judges people who don’t eat meat, and claims people need it for protein. Since he is the one who cooks I’m forced to eat meat almost every day, and only have meat options when I eat lunch. 

He’s also touchy about his cooking and would probably make me cook my own meals if I wasn’t going to eat what he made. 

I’m also a really awkward person, and don’t like causing a ruckus or making people change their ways just for me. 

My cousins and uncle are also 100% pro meat and would judge me and make me feel bad and question my decisions.

I don't want to contribute to an abusive industry, but I love sushi. Its probably my only real birthday wish every year. I love eggs and milk is probably my favorite non-soda drink (I'm trying so hard to kick the soda habit and milk helps).

only human

Death is on my shoulder

making my existence colder

I’m the only one here

who knows where we’re going

that’s a fucked up fact

my mind to be bestowing

and sometimes

it makes it hard 

simply being alive

what am I even doing here

if we’re just supposed to survive

and what’s even more fucked up

is it’s only for me to thrive

with all these other guys

subjected to only fight for their lives

and even when i know all these things

and I know of their fight

I still just discard them and kill them

in a designated fucking building

telling me it’s just what I gotta do to survive

and it’s just part of human life

I even fear death

but never stops and wonders why

i took it upon myself 

to carry out his sentence

But I just wipe the blood of my hands

after all i'm only human

and to err is my fate

but when were the only sentience

who can dictate

they whyy  
when even amongst ourselves

we declare war on dictators and their tyranny

are we not seeing the hypocrisy

and the tyrants we’ve been  


and when death is a business

it becomes my business

to declare my testimonial witness

to this sickness

and how we’re all stricken

but we cannot  see it ourselves

after all we’re ""only"" human",vegetarian,dreampsyched,1576042339,8,True,2019-12-11

It has been a desire of mine to transition to a more plant based diet with ovo-lacto vegetarian being my main diet, but I keep running into some road blocks, so it never gets off the ground. 

Over the last 2 years, I have made great strides in upping my veggie and whole food intake, with a lot more fresh foods and a lot less processed foods.  I don't eat nearly as much red meat (2-3 times a year), and the bulk of my protein comes from lean fish or poultry where I know the source.  So, I have slowly been cutting down my animal protein consumption but have hit a road block. 

I have endometriosis, and as it happens Gluten causes it to flare up pretty terribly putting me into terrible pain, so I have had to cut that entirely from my diet, I also have to limit soy intake for similar reasons (so I save it for sushi and miso soup).  Because a lot of ""meat replacement"" products are heavy on gluten and soy (I live in a rural so my options are limited), I can't eat many of them, and struggle with how processed some are.  I am also not a huge fan of many beans (but I keep trying!).  So my concern is how do I do this, when the diet is already limited. 

So I am looking for a place to start, resources, things like that. I need healthy protein in my diet or I struggle with my health and focus.  I am adventurous with trying new recipes and new foods.  There are very few veggies and fruits I turn my nose up at, so I have some up for the work, but I am stuck on where to start!

As an omnivore, my husband loves my cooking. We mastered the perfect steak, roasted chicken, bbq, chilis, stews, curries, and tons of ethnic dishes with animal based protein as the star of the plate.

Recently I've been wanted to transition to vegetatian due to the environmental impact and having learned all of the implications that animal protein has on our bodies, I'm pretty grossed out by most meat now. 

My husband is supportive and sometimes will eat my veggie based meals or I'll cook him a ""side"" of meat when it comes to dinner time. 

Its worked well but I've flopped a couple times(lentil sloppy joes and tempeh bacon were huge L's). I've always been secure with my abilities as a home cook but learning my way around new plant proteins have been challenging and I get discouraged. 

I'm also not a huge fan of processed meat substitutes(besides veggie burgers), so throwing a pile of chik'n strips in with whatever I'm cooking doesnt make it more appealing nor do I find it as nutritious as whole foods.

I've very recently made full switch to a vegetarian diet (2nd week almost completed, yeahh!) and I'm being told I need to be careful due to my blood type being O+. 

I've been pointed to some articles online which honestly I have issues believing due to them being very very similar to each others. And frankly, I would trust reddit more. 

All those articles are claiming persons with O blood type actually need animal protein due to a specific enzyme produced by ingestion of meat. This enzyme supposedly has the benefit of assisting the digestion of animal based protein and animal fat (which seems to be contradictory on its own with a meat free diet). And on top of that, due to meat restriction, this could lead to diabetes and cardiovascular conditions.

For my practicum I will create a meat replacement, and I will send a survey to people that eat meat replacements. The results are used in my project, and I won’t do anything else with your answers. I’ll analyse them, that’s it. Now I have to say, I never made a survey before so it might be unprofessional, feedback is therefore appreciated! :) my english isn’t the best either so excuse me for grammar errors. 

The survey consists out of 8 questions, and you don’t have to answer all of them. There are 2 yes/no questions and if you tick no, you don’t have to answer the ‘if yes’ question obviously. The time to complete is about 4 minutes,  according to surveymonkey.

491,"WWJD? I’m not religious but I have a small rant that can be related to this odd saying. Odd as it’s rarely used to really think how Jesus acted. Compassion to everyone. I make this rant here towards Vegans, but can apply to everyone.","I’ve been wanting to go vegetarian and mostly vegan for basically my whole life. I often blamed my parents for not being able to the first half of my life. Then it was income and the fact I do love meat, smoked, dried, rare, sushi, eggs, seafood etc. I am a very upset person in the way humans act and treat the planet, animals and each other and have been since a very young age, but I have also been good at putting myself in others shoes and learned you can’t make people see and act as you see fit, that’s being a nazi as people so often like to call each other these days. But I’ve come to realize that what holds me back are a few things. 

First, let’s talk about misinformation and how prevalent it is, most everyone in the agriculture field has a lot to gain in the consumption of animal products. It drives most of the industry even those growing plants as it mostly goes to feed the animals. Not to mention farming is industrialized mostly and owned by the same few corporations as the meat producers and consumer industries that distribute them all. So they put out “information” that benefits them. 

Second, stop trying to convince people to go vegan with imitation meats! No it isn’t that they know it’s not meat is the only reason they can tell the difference, that’s just ridiculous. I’ve tried several vegan meats and they never compare, maybe some are similar, but never that close unless it’s a greatly processed and seasoned/flavored product like hotdogs or some sausages but no hamburger has ever came close. Now that’s not to say they cannot be good.

Third, stop attacking and name calling. I am not posting nor ever again visiting the Vegan Reddit. Why? Because most I read was aggressive and hateful posts about anyone who doesn’t agree with them, dare I say, like a Nazi! Nothing gets people to go against you like calling them names like “omniscum”! Seriously is it working for Trump?!

So I say the things holding me back have been lack of friendly non judgmental people helping me find foods and recipes I love and enjoy so I can lessen my dependency on meat, not replace it, but not miss it being gone. People who share in a friendly way the things they love without being political or righteous about it. I am trying to improve myself and the impact I have to the world, not just in the food but all aspects of my life, and it isn’t easy for so many reasons. But being judgmental and proud doesn’t work well with me!
Try being compassionate and understanding not everyone agrees with Hitler... um you and forcing them to do so is exactly the opposite of freedom. Try compassion and sharing your recipes anyplace they fit not just as a “vegetarian/vegan” dish but just as a tasty dish, I strongly believe more people will try a delicious recipe before a artificial food that veggie burgers and the lot come off as. Why can’t it just be a delicious sandwich that happens to not contain meat?! Everyone already does this all the time anyway with many foods because they are not advertised as Vegan/vegetarian. I’m not perfect or a writer so forgive me, I just want to see people trying to be more compassionate and less “right”!

I have been for a long time tending toward a diet that is essentially created of laziness or a disinterest in putting too much effort into making food.

I am vegetarian and long have been, but I am not vegetarian for health reasons primarily.

As long as I don’t have to put in too much energy, I am okay with it. That means that often, I get food “to go”. But also I’d like to have stuff at my place.

So, my question is, what’s out there that doesn’t require much effort? I am talking about generally using no electricity. No cooking. So I guess a sweet potato or sweet potatoes are out. Things in boxes and cans are fine.

But I would like to stay on the healthier side. So of course potato chips are out.

Where I live (Guangdong) it ends up being cheaper, too. It fits in pretty much any Chinese recipe – from Mapo Tofu to Cantonese sauces. And in my (admittedly limited) experience playing around with it in the context of Western cooking, it’s also quite versatile – made for a great quick pan sauce.

I will say that if you’re drinking this straight up as a soup, you’ll probably find it less exciting than something like Japanese dashi or similar Chinese daikon/kelp based broths. This soup excels when used as, well, stock – something that you can use can use in sauces, as the base for braises, and so forth.

[There’s a video I made to go along with this](https://youtu.be/3_v6njerbCc), but I’m not 100% on this sub’s policy on YouTube recipe vids. If it’s frowned upon, just let me know and I’ll edit this out.

**Ingredients, Cantonese Superior Vegetarian Stock:**

Ok, so for the most part what we’re looking at is (roughly) equal parts dried soybean, shelled chestnut, and dried shiitake mushrooms by volume. So once you get the hang this, know that this doesn’t need to be an exact science… eyeballing is totally the way to go.

1.	*Dried Shiitake Mushrooms (冬菇), 25g -or- a half/half mix of dried shiitake mushrooms and dried straw mushrooms.* So right, we used dried shiitake mushrooms here for ease of international replication BUT I did want to include a quick aside on straw mushrooms. For the *most* traditional Cantonese vegetarian stocks, they’ll use half straw mushrooms – mushrooms that grow on dried rice reeds. They were discovered by Buddhist monks in Shaoguan (northern Guangdong) and have this awesome fragrance. The dried version of the straw mushrooms can be annoying to source even here in Guangdong these days, so don’t pull your hair out trying to source them – but if you happen to have access to some great dried mushrooms that’re local to **your** area, totally feel free to use half those, half shiitake… it’d still be true to the essence of the dish here.

2.	*Shelled chestnut (栗子肉), 80g.* Or about ~6-7 chestnuts (the weight there is for the shelled ones). Gives the soup some body.

3.	*Dried soybeans (黄豆), 100g.* Soybeans help give the stock depth. There’s actually two different routes you can go here – dried soybeans, or fresh soybean sprouts. We went with the former (again, ease of international replication), but if you can get your hands on soyabean sprouts, feel free to swap those in instead (let’s double up there though… let’s say… 200g?). Dried soybean works great but they’ve definitely got some grassy notes that you gotta balance against (the sprouts have no such issues), Note that unlike mungbean sprouts, which’re the bog-standard “bean sprout” in the west, soybean sprouts have a natural umami to them… so definitely don’t use mungbean sprouts in a stock unless you wanna be disappointed.

4.	*Rock sugar (冰糖), 5g -or- ¼ tsp granulated sugar.* We’ll finish this off with a touch of sugar to balance the grassiness of the soybean.

5.	*Optional: white peppercorns, ~20.* This soup’s largely unseasoned – up to you if you want to toss in peppercorn or not. If you have it on hand, cool; if not, I wouldn’t stress.

6.	*Optional: dried red dates (红枣).* This’s another ingredient that’s sometimes used to balance the soybean – I’ve seen some recipes call for like a whole handful. It makes the soup a bit on the sweet side though, and I’d rather stick with sugar for the sake of control when seasoning. But if you happen to already have dried red dates handy, there’s no harm in tossing one or two in, then doing the sugar to taste.


Oh, and four liters of water, too.

**Process:**

First off, if you’re used to cooking western stocks, note that Chinese  stocks instead (1) cook things at a heavier boil and (2) make use of reduction.

So high level overview here: reconstitute the soybeans and mushrooms in cool water overnight, toss everything in a pot with cool water, lightly boil everything until reduced by half, season and strain. Simple, yeah?

1.	*Reconstitute the dried mushrooms and dried soybeans with cool water for at least ~3 hours, or overnight.* Separate bowls – we’ll be making use of the shiitake mushroom’s soaking liquid, but not the soybean’s. Be sure to leave a couple inches of water above the mushroom/beans in order to give them room to expand into.

2.	*Transfer everything except the sugar to a pot of ~4L of cool water. Strain the shiitake mushroom soaking liquid into the pot as well.* Shiitake mushroom soaking liquid is awesome – super underrated ingredient. Hell, you can even use the soaking liquid straight up… IMO it’s *better* than stock – makes for a badass mushroom risotto.  Note that if you happen to be using half some-other-sort-of-dried-mushroom, taste your soaking liquid before mindlessly tossing it in. E.g. those straw mushrooms I was talking about? Their soaking liquid’s a bit *too* strong and has some bitterness to it.

3.	*Get the pot up to a boil.* As it starts to boil, you’ll notice there’ll be a slight bit of foam from the proteins of the soybeans. Skim it, don’t skim it, up to you. While not as cloudy as some, this stock won’t be overly clear anyhow… barring you going all consommé on it and using an egg white raft or some shit.

4.	*Swap your flame to medium/medium-low and let it bubble away until reduced by half, ~3 hours.* The reduction’ll concentrate the flavors.

5.	*Season with sugar, then strain.* Vegetarian stock, done.


**Note on what to do with all those leftovers.**

Ok, so that’s a good quantity of beans and such that’re leftover. Definitely don’t toss them – they’re good to eat. Perfect for a quick kinda ‘fuck it, everything in the pot’ braise.

Like, the other day when I was testing this I whipped up a bit of a quick stew using the leftovers that was way more delicious than it had any right to be. It was non-veg, and I didn’t exactly measure stuff (when cooking for myself it’s using eyeballing/going by ratio), but I figure that it wouldn’t hurt to leave a ‘vegetarian-ized’ version of the dish here if y’all want it. Note that unlike the above stock recipe, this isn’t authentic to… anything. But just to give ya an idea so that the stuff doesn’t go to waste.

Grab a couple of your leftover shiitake mushrooms and finely dice. Ditto with a couple cloves of garlic, ~1 inch or so ginger, and the white portion of let’s say ~4 scallion. Fry those in butter (I dunno… 6tbsp? Or whatever oil if you’re vegan) until lightly browned, then add in an equal amount of flour to make a simple roux. Fry for a minute or two until blonde, then add in your leftovers, Shaoxing wine (~1/4 cup), light soy sauce (~1/4 cup), dark soy sauce (~1 tbsp), slab sugar (~1-2 square inch chunk), a cinnamon stick, and enough water (and maybe a slug or two of the veg stock we just made) to submerge everything. Let it bubble for about 30 minutes or until thickened. If it’s not thick enough for you, hit it with a cornstarch slurry until it is. Season with MSG, optionally salt if its not salty enough, optionally sugar if its not sweet enough, optionally a touch of Chinkiang vinegar if its too sweet. Top with the green part of some scallion. Eat with some crusty bread.

For example, this Monday just gone, we ordered takeaway from a new Mediterranean place. It had these gyros that were so good, but I forgot when we ordered that they would be kebab meat. I guess it'll be better luck next time, I'll keep at it and hope it turns out good! Last week we had mac and cheese and we didn't add any bacon bits, so I know it's possible!

54,"Slow Cooker Butter ""Chicken"" Tempeh","Ever start making dinner only to discover that plans changed, so nobody will be around to eat it? That's what created this recipe. I had plans for butter ""chicken"" tempeh that got started (got as far as the marinade) when I found out my fiancee and I were now planning to go out with some friends. I stuck the tempeh in the fridge. The next day is the ""late night"" for everyone in my house, so we usually make crock pot meals. I'd never made this recipe in a slow cooker before so I was concerned, but it seemed worth a shot. I didn't think it would be as good as my usual creamy, tomato-y, spicy go-to for tempeh.

Y'all. It was even BETTER.  


No picture because we DEMOLISHED it! When I make it again I might repost. But I thought I'd give y'all a quick recipe because this was a fully DIY experiment that I can't believe worked.  


Recipe is vegetarian, but not vegan - someone more experienced in vegan cooking than I might be able to adapt, of course.  


* 1 16oz can of tomato paste
* 1 brick of tempeh
* 2 cups vegetable stock
* 3/4 cup plain greek yogurt (plus more for serving)
* 1 small yellow onion, diced
* 3 cloves garlic, smashed and diced
* 1 tablespoon cumin
* 1 tablespoon ginger
* 2 tablespoons turmeric
* 3 tablespoons yellow curry powder
* Sprinkle of cinnamon
* 1 stick butter, cut into chunks
* 1/2 cup heavy cream
* 1/2 teaspoon brown sugar

&amp;#x200B;

1. Mix 1 tablespoon of turmeric and 1 tablespoon of curry powder with the greek yogurt
2. Slice the tempeh into thin strips and toss into the greek yogurt mixture
3. Allow to marinate in the fridge - at least 2 hours, but I ended up going overnight
4. Dump all the other ingredients EXCEPT the heavy cream and brown sugar into the crock pot and whisk together
5. Add yogurt marinade and tempeh
6. Cook on low for 5 hours, stirring on occasion
7. After 5 hours, add brown sugar and heavy cream. If it's too bitter or spicy for your taste, add more vegetable stock to help smooth it out
8. Cook another 30 mins - 1 hr
9. Serve over basmati rice with a dollop of greek yogurt on top

&amp;#x200B;

The slow, low cook really helps all the flavors come together. I firmly believe this is the tastiest way to prepare tempeh, too - the textures work together so well.

59,Going vegetarian with young kids,"My husband and I were previously vegetarian for a short time and then when we had kids found it was easier to eat meat and plan meals with little ones. I also have a bit of weirdness and guilt about making a kid eat vegetarian even though we are planning to go back to being vegetarian because it’s a healthier way of living. I suppose it would be good if some of you could give me advice on that or talk me into it being acceptable for my kids to be vegetarians also. Something about it feels like I am depriving them.

I am also completely new to this and have a lot of general dislikes for food (not picky but I have a thing about certain textures) so I wonder if there are non-processed, kid friendly options that would work for a weeknight dinner? I really want to make this work and was vegetarian for a year before going back to eating meat. I never really got into expanding my foods and have no clue how to prep or cook most of the things I see in the grocery store.... Artichokes boggle my mind. Are there good resources or websites or a central spot I can find reliable advice on how to do this stuff? Googling is fine but I’d love to have either a cookbook or one single site where I can peruse the articles and recipes all in one place to get familiar with things. 

Any other advice you have would be great.

92,Moral reasons to not eat meat you didn't buy?,"I've been vegetarian for just about two months now. I'm not super hardcore or self-righteous about it; really one day I was just like ""nah, killing animals unnecessarily isn't cool"" and that was the end of it. I made some adjustments to my diet and it hasn't been entirely too challenging. However, I work in a cafe, and we routinely throw out expired sandwiches, many of which contain meat. These are freely available for employees to take. Since I'm a broke-ass mf, 3-5 meals a week being taken care of for me would help a lot. And since they would literally be going in the trash otherwise, I don't see how me consuming these sandwiches would contribute to the exploitation of animals.

139,Transitioning to Vegetarian with cheat days,"First time posting on this subreddit! I’ve been lurking for some time now, and the community is what finally convinced me to go Vegetarian.

So I finally decided to become Vegetarian 2 months ago but I’m finding it hard to go full Vegetarian. I decided to go cold turkey, which might not be a good idea. 

My boyfriend still eats meat but is really considerate and supportive of my choice, so are my friends. Whenever we order food, they would order a Vegetarian option for me. See, the problem is, whenever I’m eating alone I don’t crave meat at all, but when I’m eating with my friends and see them eating meat, I suddenly have the urge to try their food. I think it might be related to psychology more, how we crave the things we don’t have (Although I’m not sure).  So when I see my friends eating meat, I crave in and eat some
of their and would feel guilty afterwards, because whenever I do, I would go back to eating meat for a while then completely stoping again once I felt enough guilt. I realize this might not be a healthy approach to food so I decided to try something new. I gave myself “cheat days” once a week. 

I would go a week without eating meat then on Sunday I would treat myself to one meat-based main course, whether it be for lunch or dinner. So if I ate meat for lunch, I wont eat it for dinner or vice versa. Then I’ll slowly to once every two weeks, then once a month, and so on and so fort. 

I wanted to know if anyone else had tried this way in order to slowly transition to Vegetarianism? Are cheat days even allowed? Can I even still call myself Vegetarian if I eat meat once in a while?",vegetarian,anunimportantaccount,1572762285,10,True,2019-11-03

I'm thinking about doing the same thing for eggs and dairy--that is, not eliminating something as an option just because it says or might have 'skim milk' as the 9th ingredient on the list. Sometimes I feel it's just too restrictive for my current lifestyle. I'm getting older and have more responsibilities at home and work, etc. Sometimes I don't want to fret about the ingredients and just enjoy the experience at a restaurant or cafe.

I do a lot of physical activity and I'm finding it harder to stay as lean as I like as I get older. This has brought me around to the idea of being vegetarian. The issue is, I do understand the concept of a complete protein and I do believe you need them. I also believe you can get that from a plant based diet but information about how to go about doing that is very slim. Even in the FAQ in this sub theres a list of proteins, but no breakdown of the combinations required to build complete profiles. For somebody like myself that controls nutrition down to the micronutrient this is absolutely maddening. I don't mind doing my own leg work on building the flavors around it, but I need to know my constraints. I'm sick of reading 'dont worry, you'll get complete proteins'. Its a concern, and I cant start without settling it. I don't understand why  'this is how you get a complete protein' isnt more accessible and easily digestible.

Usually I’m fine with it when I eat pizza but now I can’t.This is all I’m burping up right now is a pepperoni taste.Meat smells also make me really sick too.

232,I have a huge problem with Hunting animals as a Hobby.,"This is probably going to be controversial- I'm just going to clarify that hunting does not make someone a bad person, but I think hunting is a bad thing. I also want to clarify that I am in a first-world country, in an area where majority of poverty is in the city. 

Meat-eating culture is a huge aspect where I live- in fact, so cultural that the meat farmers come on the radio about once a month to shit talk the Plant-based burgers at the local A&amp;W. The area I'm in is extremely rural, with lots of meat farms, vegetable farms, crops and forest. Hunting is extremely common in this area, and I'm starting to have a problem with it. I'm fine with omnivorous people (my family and friends are omnivorous) and I feel like it isn't in my place to comment on someone's diet negatively, however I have a huge problem with hunting for leisure. 

I believe that hunting is only in good taste if you need it. You're in a life or death situation, where you either have to eat or be eaten- and there are no other food sources nearby- but this is a situation many people are not in. Why on earth does someone need to hunt when the grocery store is nearby, with meat already in it?  You're paying for ammunition, firearms, camo clothes, licenses, traps, snares- it's going to take a lot of killing for you to save money on meat. You're killing an animal that you don't need, only for the game of killing something. And of course you post the body on instagram, tie it on your truck and drive through town to run errands with it strapped to your vehicle. Don't get me wrong, I hate factory farming, but there's already dead animals at the store. You physically do not have to go out and shoot something when there's meat you can already eat and already do eat. Sure, the animals you're eating that you hunted had a better life, but you still ended it when you did not have to. 

The methods of hunting aren't even humane. Hunters set up traps around the countryside that suffocate animals for fur and meat, and last year I lost my one-year-old golden retriever to a trap hidden near my property. What is the point of killing something for fun- people in my area have become so pent up with the joy of killing something that they run over coyotes for amusement, choke them, kill them and post it on the internet as well. 

Sorry about the controversy- I am very against hunting and what it's doing in my area. I feel like losing my dog Jasper was my turning point. Does anyone agree or disagree? Whatever your opinion is please let me know. I'd like to know if maybe I'm going a little too extreme on the hunters. Thank you.",vegetarian,polipodo,1572976585,6,True,2019-11-05

My parents promised me they would have vegetarian options but when they brought out the food everything was covered in meat gravy. There literally wasn’t one vegetarian option :( not even the veggies as they were cooked with ham.

I recently moved back pretty close to my hometown. Where I grew up, you either become a farmer/teacher, or leave. There’s a grocery store, a school, and 30+ farms. Most of them are dairy/beef farms. 

Now of course you and I know the importance of living meat/animal product free. But a lot of these people are my lifelong friends. I’m not the type to cut someone out because they’re still living the omni lifestyle. They aren’t demons, and I grew up around their farms. They’re small/family owned and nothing like the ones you see on shock docs. I’m not saying this makes it right, or that I agree with it, but I’m just saying. 

These people are hurting. Heading for bankruptcy. I’m definitely not going to change my mind on my beliefs, but I can’t help but feel sympathy for the people I grew up with, who have known nothing else. Didn’t go to college or learn a trade. There’s no other industry in our area, no alternatives besides trying to sell the land that no one wants, or commuting two hours one way to a different job, if they can even find one.

I was trying to think of some foods that are naturally on the menu for thanksgiving that are at least vegetarian. I'm drawing blanks though. 

What foods can I ask my family to make that won't make me seem like a total pain in the ass? I'll be bringing my own tofurky ham so that part won't be a huge deal, just pop it in the oven.

I only went vegetarian recently (5 months ago), so I’m hoping I can get by without having to cook any more meat.

A : Choose and prepare 3 meals that would help a family who is trying to eat healthy on a limited income

B : Choose 3 meals that would be suitable at a hotel restaurant for Valentine’s Day. 

There’s a lot more to this including research, but I’m not gonna bore you with the details. We should also be trying to demonstrate skill here, but it’s not too important. (Just not meals that are *incredibly* easy)

Instantly, I thought A would be the best choice, I find it most interesting and vegetables can be pretty cheap and healthy.

313,Holiday deserts?,"Good evening, ladies and gents.

&amp;#x200B;

I've a birthday coming up, and wanted to invite a few people in, when I've learned that one of my friends turned (lacto-)vegetarian. On its own, it's not a problem to come up with good dishes - the best things I cook are already vegetarian/vegan, but what made me think harder were deserts, which often have eggs and gelatin in them - which she wouldn't want to eat. I love baking, but I've never made anything vegan before, and am a bit lost. Of course, I could've made separate meals for her, but I wouldn't want to separate the group like tha.

&amp;#x200B;

The first suggestion I had was vegetarian carrot cake, but the thing is, my birthday is very early January, so we'll be celebrating it, Christmas, and New Year's Eve at this one day, so I'd really love to make something more flamboyant, so to speak, to sort of support this holiday mood, and cookies and carrot cakes are usually quite ""ordinary"" so to speak. You wouldn't expect them on a triple occasion when you're a guest.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm considering chickpea mousses over agar-based jelly, but I'm sure there are much more recipes and/or tips hidden in your cookbooks you could point me to, so everyone would be happy and comfortable.

324,"Recipe: One of my top chocolate-chip cookie recipes (gluten-free as well, and actually GOOD!)","# [Photo](https://i.imgur.com/Su8uh5H.jpg) 

## What's awesome about this recipe:

The picture is a bit deceiving - these are amazingly good chocolate-chip cookies.  Like, *awesomely* good.  No dairy.  No flour.  No eggs.  No refined sugar.  They're *almost* vegan, aside from the honey (I haven't tried any vegan honeys with this recipe yet, like Bee Free Honee, but I'd imagine it'd work fine...might have to try date syrup down the road too!).

They kind of bake up in the shape of a ball, because they don't really spread out.  They are best enjoyed warm (or warmed up a bit), like with a 10 or 20-minute cooling period out of the oven to let the chocolate re-solidify a bit.  

## Ingredients:

* 2 cups Almond Meal (regular, not fine)
* 1/4 teaspoon Sea Salt (plus a bit extra for topping)
* 1/3 teaspoon Baking Soda
* 1/4 cup Coconut Oil (melted)
* 1 Tablespoon Honey
* 1 Tablespoon Maple Syrup
* 2 teaspoons Vanilla ([imitation is fine](https://sweets.seriouseats.com/2013/12/taste-test-is-better-vanilla-extract-worth-the-price.html))
* 1/3 cup Dark Chocolate Chips (I like Enjoy Life's [mini semi-sweet](https://enjoylifefoods.com/products/semi-sweet-chocolate-mini-chips-1?variant=20209502879855) chocolate chips)
* 1/3 cup Walnuts

## Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 350F
2. Mix almond meal, salt, baking soda by hand (I use a [Danish dough whisk](https://www.amazon.com/Original-Danish-Dough-Whisk-alternatives/dp/B00HQQJ3N6))
3. Add coconut oil (melt in microwave bowl or stovetop pot), honey, maple syrup, vanilla, and mix well
4. Stir chocolate chips &amp; walnuts (just crush the walnuts by hand to make them the size you want) into mixture
5. Roll into a ball (ice cream scooper helps; I usually make them about 1.5"" tall) - the mixture is usually crumbly &amp; needs to be pressed together by hand to stay in a ball - and place onto a parchment-lined baking sheet
6. Gently flatten with your palm as you put them on the cookie sheet (they don't spread out much)
7. Add a pinch of sea salt to the top
8. Bake for 10 to 18 minutes, until the outer edges are golden brown",vegetarian,kaidomac,1573227183,1,True,2019-11-08

342,"My parents are staunchly against my choice to be vegetarian, can I get some support please?","The same arguments, the same discussion over and over again. My mom literally cried tonight when I said that chicken stock wasn't vegetarian. She asked me ""who are you trying to impress?"" and that REALLY hurt me.

Some common arguments from my parents in quotes, and my responses in parentheses:

""It's not natural, we evolved to be omnivores"" 

(Natural doesn't automatically make it better)

""Experts don't know everything, what if you need something in meat that they haven't found yet?""

(On one hand I have all of this evidence for why eating meat is not a good idea, and on the other hand I have this nebulous argument about things scientists may not have found yet. I'm liable to choose from the side I know more about)

""Why not just eat organic or ethically sourced meat?"" 

(Because I can't know for certain that that animal wasn't tortured, and besides, cutting an animal's life short just because I like the taste isn't ethical)

""It's not healthy/balanced to cut an entire food group from you diet""

(As long as you're supplementing with plant proteins and B12 then you're getting all the same stuff) 

""Soy is so bad for you. Your grandmother ate soy and she bled because of the estrogen"" (true story as far as I know)

(Soy is not bad for you, it's a food like any other)

""There are things in animal meat that you JUST CAN'T GET from plants"" 

(That's why I carefully monitor my protein intake, as well as take a B12 supplement) 

""Yeah but B12 supplements are scary/there was a study that found a link with cancer"" 

(As far as we know, B12 supplements are safe and effective) 

""It's worse for the environment to make fertilizer for fruits/vegetables than ANY amount of factory farming or cow farts""

(Even if that was true, which it isn't, why would I ADD to the amount of greenhouse gasses and overall suffering by choosing to eat meat? I could still lessen impact by choosing to not eat meat. I don't have a choice when it comes to fruits and veggies, you need to eat those) 

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see I can hold my own, but damn it's getting old. Also every time we have the discussion, I feel like I'm being gaslit, or that maybe vegetarianism isn't healthy. What really fucks me up is that my parents simultaneously say that you can't defer to the experts, but then they do it all the time, so when I go online after each discussion to make sure vegetarianism is healthy, I feel like I can't trust anyone, and that's a super dangerous mindset to fall into. So I guess I feel like I just need support. Was anyone else's parents/loved ones just completely against them being vegetarian? I feel like this is an insane reaction, and normally my parents are very level-headed people. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tonight I went out to a high end Spanish tapas restaurant for dinner with a friend. I went to this restaurant a couple of years ago and it was really good. But unfortunately tonight’s experience has tainted that memory.

It’s important to note that this restaurant markets itself as being vegetarian, vegan and gluten free friendly, while not exclusively being vegetarian. I ordered a tasting plate (a mix of the different tapas items) and requested that it be made vegetarian. The waiter confirmed that would be OK and so I ordered it. When it came out, everything looked vegetarian so I ate through it. I got to one dish that appeared to look like thing onion rings and took one bite and realised it was calamari! 

I let the waiter know that I had in fact ordered a vegetarian version of the tasting plate and he was so rude about it. No apology. No offer to replace my dish with something else. Just a “so what” attitude. I was just so shocked at how dismissive he was! I understand that people make mistakes but this was unacceptable behaviour. I expect better, especially at a high end restaurant. 

We went and paid for the bill (the same rude waiter handled this). I then went downstairs and found another waitress and explained the incident. She was very apologetic and took down my name and email address. Let’s see if I hear back from that restaurant.

To give some background info on myself, I'm in my mid 30s, M, 6'1, underweight and somewhat fit. I don't work out but the type of work I do is physically demanding so I guess that would be some form of an exercise. Where I come from, meat is a part of our culture and I grew up eating a lot of it. I never thought twice about changing my diet unless it was to try and gain weight when I was younger, which I did attempt for the sake of trying to look 'normal'. Even when I would count my calories and ate a surplus consistently, it was too tiring to force myself to eat when I wasn't hungry and if I skipped a beat, my metabolism got the best of me, so I have since stopped caring about it. It also made me feel sluggish.

My diet for the last 5 years or so hasn't been anything interesting. I wake up and eat 5 scrambled eggs with a cup of coffee for breakfast, I used to eat fast food for lunch everyday but have since skipped lunch going on a year now and stuck to eating snacks, and for dinner it's basically whatever I can cook up. Other than being underweight and looking sick, I consider myself to be healthy (self diagnosed). I don't get sick, ever, but I don't know if that's a gene thing or what. Although I feel healthy, I know I don't eat healthy and I'm sure my insides are bad.

The documentary was put together well and it sparked some interest for me. I was thinking about taking steps to going with a vegetarian diet first and maybe a vegan diet eventually. I wake up really early for work, so because of the little time it takes to make eggs and coffee, that's what I've been sticking with. I'd like to substitute the eggs but with my lack of imagination and cooking skills, I don't know a quick vegetarian substitute which is why I'm here.

415,Where else should I look for high protein-low calories ingredients,"Hey.   

I turned vegetarian last year and my physical appearance and health had got worse and worse. I'm struggling to stay vegetarian. I haven't touched meat since then but I struggle to get enough protein on a daily basis. I struggle a lot. And the food I'm eating ... Man 100% is not healthy.  

 So.   

Here it is.  

 I need 130g of proteins per day. 

An example of a day:   

Breakfast  

Quacker oats satchet + 180ml cashew milk + 25g cashew + 1 toast + 10g peanut butter (523kcal 21g protein 51g carbs 26g fat)   

Snack  

Proteins youghurt (126 20 0.4 0.4)  

Lunch  

2 toast + 50g mature cheddar + 30g tomatoes + 30g cucumber + Quorn smoky ham slices (465kcal 33 48 14) 

snack 

phd whey protein bar (248kcal 30g protein 19g carbs 6g fat)

dinner 

100g mashed potatoes + 3 veg sausages + 40g halloumi + 50g tomatoes + 50g cucumber (390kcal 27g protein 22g carbs 22g fats) 

Now, the protein youghurt, and the protein bar -&gt; that's not healthy. 100%. the quorn smoky ham slices ... same. that's not healthy. it is processed food. 

I don't enjoy the food either. 

My blood checks (which I do every six months) are getting worse, my body fat percentage went from 13% to 20%. body mass it's still ok, but growth and exercise responsiveness is awful. 

My diet seems to depend more and more on protein shakes, b12 supplements, magnesium suplements, zinc supplements. I am always tiered and hungry. Also, I am an endomorph which means I can't eat too much to get my proteins from lentils or broccoli. I need sources with low calories and high protein.

When I talk about this stuff to my friends and family they all either tell me being vegetarian isn't healthy because you don't get proper nutrition (which is completely false) or they shrug and say well that's not my problem or that they love meat too much to even consider stopping. When I try to explain what they are saying is not true, that meat and dairy are completely unnecessary to consume they either say ""it's too hard"" or ""I don't care I love meat too much.""

Seriously? You don't care about the alarming rate at which the Earth is being destroyed? You don't care about the world will be in a seriously bad state by the year 2040. Seriously seriously bad shape. Some people have literally said to me ""well, I'll be long dead before any of this affects me.""

Oh really? What about your children, or your grand children, which a lot of these people had. They will be hugely affected by this. Most of the time I get a shrug or ""I don't know what to tell you.""

People seem to almost take it like a personal attack that I would even consider they shouldn't eat meat or dairy. Have people truly been this brainwashed? It's completely baffling to me.

What can I do about this? Nothing? I try to raise awareness surrounding these issues but I pretty much get a resounding ""I don't care."" I'm actually at a state now that I don't think I could consume a steak just out of the pure morality of it.

What ingredients and dishes give you the satiated feeling?","My fiancee and I have considered going vegetarian, or semi-vegetarian for years. It started out as ""eliminate foods that make us violently ill"" (pork and most dairy, for some reason cheese is fine for us, but any other dairy product makes us feel like we have the flu). We're probably going to keep eating fish and occasionally turkey because they don't make us sick, but we can't eat that every day so we're looking for alternatives. 

The issue that we keep running into is that meat dishes give us the feeling of being satiated after a meal. When I eat something that doesn't have either a meat product or a TON of protein (like a smoothie with 40+ grams of protein per serving), I'm very hungry again soon after and end up eating a lot more food in the long run.

41,People who are more concerned with the purity of their food rather than the results of their choices.,"Why? It's more of an eating disorder than an ethical choice at that point.

This is obviously personal experience but almost every single vegan and fellow vegetarian I've met is extremely concerned about not putting animal products in their body even accidentally or in small insignificant amounts. Like that is what matters, rather than making decisions to not eat meals with animal products to reduce the demand and therefore the harm they cause. 

Especially something like making a big deal about how their food needs to be cooked on a grill/flattop that didn't have animal products on it previously. This one is straight up ridiculous. You eating food that came off a grill that cooked someone else's meal does not change how much suffering was caused by their choice in meal nor how much you prevent with your choice in meal. If you could taste it sure but it's rather unlikely you will taste anything from a properly scraped and heated flat top. A restaurant my friend works at has an entirely separate flat top for vegetarian only purposes and only because the kitchen is visible to the front. Thanks to all those people involved in making such a big deal out of literally nothing that this restaurant is burning gas just to run a separate flat top.

And, I'm coming from a place of concern, not one of finger-pointing so please, please be kind!

I used be a strict vegetarian and was happily consuming brands like Morningstar Farms for their patties and sausages, etc. One day, while reading articles about cleaner eating, I realized that so much of what I was eating was frozen products that are ultra-processed. I know that ""processed"" is a pretty broad term and that any food that isn't simply pulled out of the ground and placed on the shelf as-is is technically processed. 

But, the vegetarian foods just seem ... so, so fake and not in a good way. The ingredients lists are pretty unnerving. And I have to admit, the BeyondMeat products make me feel a little squeaky inside. Are these foods truly healthy? Healthy for us and the planet? I know we all don't have the time or the money to stand in our kitchens all weekend doing food prep for the week, but I'm failing to see how they are at all beneficial especially when it comes to packaging. 

Now, I'll still occasionally buy a tray of Amy's cheese enchiladas and mow down on that sucker like there's no tomorrow, but Amy's has been around for ages and it just seems like these newer companies are just jumping on the latest food trend and are approaching it from a money-making stand point, and not one of health for us or the environment.

As the title states I'm going to try being vegetarian for a period of 6 months starting November 1st.  I'm doing it both as a challenge to myself as well as using this diet as a way of regulating/tracking what I am eating and how much.

So with that being said i'm looking for things I need to watch out for.  By eliminating my red meats I think an iron supplement can't hurt, but past that I really can't think of anything else I need to worry about.  Also, if I was to eliminate eggs from the diet, would that technically eliminate baked goods like cakes and such that use eggs in the recipe?

However, there are some nights where he's craving a burger, but I still want to avoid meat. He's always been the primary cook in our relationship, and I've just begun cooking again for the first time since college as part of my journey to enjoying more plant-forward meals, so I'm still a little nervous in the kitchen. I've been trying to find some simple, beginner-friendly vegetarian meals that I can easily whip up on the nights where I need to cook something just for myself. 

So far the only one I've managed to add to my repertoire is a simple mushrooms-and-egg-noodles dish. I cook some sliced mushrooms in a little (or a lot) of butter, add some fresh herbs and salt and garlic, then some vegetable broth once everything's had a chance to cook up a bit. I add cooked egg noodles at the end and mix it all together so that the noodles absorb the nice herb-y sauce that forms in the pot.

My boyfriend is vegetarian and we've been together for about a year now. I'm moving in with him in the next few months.

Once I move in I don't intend to eat meat in the house, (and at some point just cut it out altogether) as he's said that it would be difficult for him - I'm totally fine with that. Meat substitutes are great and it doesn't make much difference to me. 

However the one thing I'm stuck on is seafood substitutes. I was wondering if there was anything on the market that was plant-based? I've heard of some 'lobster mushrooms' but no idea where to get them. And I've tried 'Tuno' but it just tasted awful. If it helps I'm based in the UK.

&amp;#x200B;

I ll get right to the point. I eat meat all my life (i am 40 yo ) and i enjoy it a lot. Most days of the week i used to eat meat. Any kind of meat. Suddenly about a year ago poultry started to have a different taste and while i eat i get upset stomach. This have expanded to pork and beef meat. They taste kinda different and most of the times i m kind of disgusted.

&amp;#x200B;

Processed meat like sausages or minced meat are not yet a problem . Even though i rarely order takeout, i don't have a problem eating the above processed meats .

&amp;#x200B;

I m not sure what all this means. I am going to inform my doctor in my next week's appointment to try to eliminate the possibility that an infection or a disease has changed my taste. 

&amp;#x200B;

A different server came out and she asked who had the burger, and everyone said that was for me. I tried the fries with the ketchup, which tasted different so I assumed this was a vegan meal (although I think all ketchup is vegan) so I started to eat the burger, I was really hungry and I was just thinking that it was a really good vegan burger, that's when the server came back with more food, one that was a burger with a green flag and asked ""Vegan burger?"". One person on our table forget they ordered a black Angus burger, by that time I had eaten half of the burger so I gave the rest to my brother and they gotten the person who ordered the beef burger another burger:( It was kinda my fault and it made really upset that night.

The operation I work on is grass fed only, with hay in the winter. 
All that being said, when condidering non arable lands/land that requires fertilizer yearly to be agriculturally viable, which is more ethical, from an environmental standpoint, growing bison or growing wheat/corn/soybeans etc?

At first I was really happy, and then two weeks later I had returned home and, of course, hopped on the scale. I had gained a bunch of weight. At first I thought it was because I was on vacation and ate a ton, then I recently thought it was puberty just trying to make me sad. I’ve started to think about it more recently and am fully open to the idea that i’m eating more carbs and not enough protein and this could be the potential cause of my weight gain. I can’t help but think about how I was so much skinnier before I stopped eating meat. My digestive problems haven’t improved, I still get bloated very easily, and my weight gain has held a serious impact on my self confidence.

My spouse is omnivorous and I'm trying to incorporate more vegetarian and/or vegan meals into our diet that still appeal to an omnivore's palate. He is fine with beans, lentils, legumes, etc. I haven't yet tried making anything with nutritional yeast because I think that would be too much too quick.

Meat interacts with different types of dishes in different ways, so it might be easier to go on a recipe-by-recipe basis.

Here are some typical omnivorous meals for us:

Layered enchiladas (lasagna style layered)

Pasta &amp; tomato sauce with veggies

Pesto pasta

Sandwiches (meat &amp; cheese)

Mac &amp; cheese (this is fine, but I need a more protein heavy side because I don't like cheese sauce)

Mock Olive Garden Pasta Fagioli (has ground beef, otherwise fine)

Baked ziti/pasta (spouse finds the dish less fulfilling without ground beef)

Breakfast scrambler (has sausage, looking for a non-meat option that still has spiciness)

Mock Chipotle burrito bowl

.

There's no seafood in there because we don't eat any. There's also no salads because my teeth are *very* crooked and it's hard to eat leafy vegetables (we can't afford extensive dental work). We do meal prepping to save time and money, so most of our meals are things that can be easily frozen for leftovers or lunch the next day.

I could just take out the meat from my portions, but I'm worried about the amount of nutrients and calories I'm getting. I'd like to kill 2 birds with one stone by turning my meals vegetarian and hopefully adding some more nutrients.

If anybody has meal suggestions outside of what I've directly mentioned, please share! I'm always open to recipes.

I think it's an obvious answer that you should tell them before someone is going to eat something because that allows them to make an educated decision for themselves. However that's not always an option. 

I never really know what to do in that situation because I have been on both sides:

I was out at dinner the other night with a friend, I had a flat tire so she got there before me. She decided to order french fries as a snack. She had already eaten over half the plate by the time I had gotten there and was really enjoying them. I told her that they were cooked in beef tallow because I thought she deserved to know, but she was low key pissed at me. She was really mad that I ruined food that she had already eaten and had to pay for. I get where she's coming from, I very distinctly remember the day I stopped eating Poptarts because I learned they had gelatin in them. I'm glad I know, but also I was really enjoying the ignorance is bliss camp. I have had it happen dozens of time to me with multiple foods.

168,Remember: your plant-based journey is nobody's but yours,"I recently moved into a new house. I've absolutely loved it so far, and one of the main reasons is that one of my roommates is vegan and has been for some years. So between me and her, it's very easy to be a vegetarian, and even make vegan meals most of the time! However, my other roommate has been rather judgmental about how I in particular eat. I occasionally eat chicken or fish for my own reasons, and still use butter and eggs and cheese in my cooking. On these occasions, she's openly criticized my food choices, going as far as calling me a ""bad vegan."" This has been pretty frustrating at times, since I am proud of my plant-based meals and how I have been working to reduce waste, improve my health with a more intentional diet, and make more earth-friendly choices. 

SO. My point in all of this is that we are all walking this path for our own reasons. Any effort to reduce our impact, support dignity for animals, and care for ourselves and the earth is a positive and helpful step in a compassionate direction. Not all vegetarians fall so neatly into the strict view of vegetarians. Some have to eat animal products for health or other reasons. It's nobody's damn business what we put into our bodies or how much or how frequently. If you haven't eaten animal products in 10+ years, awesome! If you are reducing how much meat you eat once a week, awesome! Everything helps and everyone's effort is important.

Think Indian Street food x tacos

1) boil small potatoes (as soft as possible without getting mashed, so you can still make slices)

4) I used frozen parathas for the base. You could use  sandwich bread or whole wheat tortillas as well.
Make sure it's cooked well.

Eating a vegetarian diet is linked with many health benefits—including lower cholesterol, lower blood pressure and lower overall BMI. You'll want to make sure you're eating balanced meals and getting key nutrients that can sometimes be lacking for vegetarians and vegans, such as vitamin B12, iron and omega-3s. And whether you've just made the switch or want to shake up your dinner game, you may want some fresh ideas for what to eat. Beyond basic vegetables, fruits and whole grains, we've put together a list of our favorite vegetarian and vegan substitutes for animal proteins. These plant-based foods will help you skip the meat and still enjoy delicious meals.


Related: How Vegans Can Get the Key Nutrients They Need


1. Eggplant


Eggplant offers a meaty texture and an earthy, savory (umami) flavor. This versatile veggie can be prepared many ways, from grilling and baking to stir-frying and even stuffing (similar to a stuffed chicken breast). Try out these recipes for Stuffed Eggplant, Grilled Eggplant &amp; Baba Ghanoush and Eggplant-Shallot Stew.


2. Mushrooms


It's become quite popular to use portobello mushrooms as a substitute for a burger (like our Grilled Eggplant &amp; Portobello Sandwich), but mushrooms can do so much more. Chopped, sliced or ground mushrooms provide a meaty texture and earthy, smoky flavor that works well in the place of meat. Try your hand at subbing in mushrooms for meat in these recipes for Portobello ""Philly Cheese Steak"" Sandwich, Wild Mushroom &amp; Polenta Casserole and Asparagus &amp; Mushroom Risotto.


3. Tofu


Similar to chicken, this soy-based vegetarian protein takes on the flavors of what it is seasoned and cooked with. This makes tofu an excellent canvas for introducing all types of flavors (like our Tofu Curry, Tofu Stroganoff and Tofu Parmigiana, to name a few). Plus, a 3-ounce serving of tofu packs in 9 grams of protein.


4. Seitan


Sometimes referred to as ""the vegetarian white meat,"" this wheat-based protein is a great option and provides a similar mouthfeel to chicken (in fact, many imitation chicken products on the market are made with seitan). You can buy seitan where you find tofu in most large grocery stores. Try our recipe for Crispy Seitan Stir-Fry or Malaysian Seitan, Broccoli &amp; Mushroom Fried Rice to get you started.



5. Lentils


These legumes are surprisingly high in protein, with 9 grams per 1/2 cup (cooked). Their hearty texture and peppery flavor make them a good stand-in for ground beef in many recipes, such as Vegetarian Shepherd's Pie, Lentil Burgers and Squash, Chickpea &amp; Red Lentil Stew. Lentils come in a variety of colors including red, brown, black and green and ounce for ounce cost less than meat. You can buy them dried or canned.


6. Beans


Similar to lentils, beans are a good swap for beef in many recipes. Beans deliver around 8 grams of protein and 8 grams of fiber per 1/2-cup serving, though it may vary slightly depending on the type of bean. Top your salad with beans or use them in Vegetarian Chili or in place of meat in tacos and Vegetarian Taco Salad.


7. Tempeh


This soy-based protein is similar to tofu (which is also a great substitute for fish), but usually has a firmer texture, a darker brown color and a nutty flavor. Tempeh contains all the essential amino acids so it's a great vegetarian protein source and because it's fermented, it delivers probiotics (good bacteria essential for gut health). Tempeh is great grilled, as in our Grilled Tempeh Salad with Sesame-Ginger Dressing, or try it pan-fried in our Smothered Tempeh Sandwich and Sesame-Honey Tempeh &amp; Quinoa Bowl.


8. Jackfruit


It seems strange to think of a fruit as a substitute for meat, but the texture of jackfruit is actually quite similar to shredded chicken (and also works well in place of pulled pork). Though this tropical fruit looks intimidating from the outside, it's sold in supermarkets in cans and in the refrigerated section with other meat substitutes.


9. Cauliflower


Cauliflower is a mild vegetable and has a reputation for being able to stealthily replace certain foods, such as potatoes and even pizza crust. Vegans can enjoy ""egg"" salad by mashing cauliflower in this Vegan Cauliflower ""Egg"" Salad recipe. Caulifower also replaces the chicken in these Sriracha-Buffalo Cauliflower Bites and makes a healthy choice for ""meatballs"" in these Saucy Vegetarian Meatballs

I ordered the Gardein firecracker wings and devoured one as soon as it arrived. I noticed the taste to be off a tad but it just so happens this serving had the most sesame seeds I've ever seen it served with, and blamed the taste on that. (We had even had the first serving as an appetizers, this one was my entree) before I took my second bite, out of nowhere I realized that my dish was missing yardhouse's trademark wood stick that identifies the Gardein wings from the traditional boneless wings. My heart sank. ""Honey, is this real meat"" blood drains out of my face. He takes a bite, and this far into my horror story, I'm sure you have realized, it was indeed real chicken.

251,Hemorrhoids after I stopped eating meat? :(,"Hey y’all. 

Experimented with vegetarianism every now and then since I was 16. A month here, four months there, etc. Never made it longer than six months because I’d get stomach problems and my BM would get wack as fuck. 

I’m 21 now and I’ve only eaten meat once or twice since March. It was fine for a while, then started to become a nuisance, and now it’s a problem. 

I eat processed foods from time to time (like veg burgs and other meatless options, and some junk food) but for the most part I eat rice, beans, and vegetables. 

Also, I do drink a lot of caffeine; usually the equivalent of 3-4 cups of coffee. And I drink all caffeine: tea, coffee, yerba mate, energy drinks. I also smoke a half pack a day and about 1g of weed, but I don’t think those things would interfere with my digestion that much. 

And my drug habits have been like that for the past 2 years or so. It’s only when I stop eating meat that I get these stomach problems. 

Can anyone offer me any advice? Like I’m seriously considering going back to eating meat because of how my health has been affected, even though meat absolutely disgusts me now and I plan on cutting out all animal products by the end of next year. 

My shits are literally holding me back.

252,Grilled Teriyaki Chicken Salad :),"Ingredients:

½ cup teriyaki sauce,

4 boneless skinless chicken breasts, pounded to even thickness

8 cups chopped romaine or green leaf lettuce

½ cup cherry tomatoes, halved

¼ red onion, thinly sliced

2 avocados, sliced

1 15-ounce can pineapple rings, with juice (juice divided between marinade and dressing, see instructions)

cilantro, roughly chopped


Dressing:

½ cup teriyaki sauce

⅓ cup rice vinegar or apple cider vinegar

⅓ cup olive oil

pineapple juice (from the can of pineapple rings)


Instructions:

Combine chicken, ½ cup teriyaki sauce, and half of the pineapple juice from your can of pineapple slices in a large resealable bag. Press the extra air out of the bag, seal, and chill for 15 minutes.

In a small-medium bowl combine all dressing ingredients, whisk to combine, then cover and chill until ready to use.

Grease and preheat your grill. Place chicken on grill and discard bag with marinade. Place chicken and pineapple rings on the grill. Grill pineapple rings just until hot and tender and grill marks start to form. Grill chicken 6-10 minutes on each side until browned and cooked all the way through (completely white inside, no pink). Transfer to cutting board and slice into strips or chop into 1-inch pieces.


Assemble salads with chopped lettuce on the bottom, then top with chicken, tomatoes, onions, avocado slices, grilled pineapple slices and cilantro. Serve with prepared dressing (stir or shake immediately before serving). Top with sesame seeds if desired. The thicker the teriyaki sauce, the better.

My concern is around ethics of farming plus environment and health (when I was a vegetarian it was at first a simpler 'killibg is wrong' but by the end of it I felt e.g. free range meat was better than battery eggs and ultimately my concern was welfare rather than rights/life.

I've heard different accounts of the relative welfare issues of meat v dairy/eggs and also seen some environmental concerns around some veggie/vegan alternative proteins (soy?) Instinctively I'd assume eating beef is worse environmentally but better ethically than eating chicken (partially conditions, partially just that one cow feeds more than one chicken. But not sure whether e.g. free range meat from small ethical farms is preferable to the vast majority of cheese from mass produced milk.

Are there any sources that weigh up the relative environmental/welfare coats of various animal products?

This is a vegetarian sub. I am always SO glad to see anyone who is making baby steps towards a plant-based lifestyle, but this sub is for vegetarian specific content. 

If you are an omni looking for veg recipes, heck yeah. 

If you are someone casually interested in vegetarianism, and want some tips - I'm all about it. 

But today there was a post about being pescatarian, and it had over 250 upvotes and about 70 comments talking about how eating meat is okay when its X animal or in moderation. 

There are subs to talk about those topics. This is not the sub. There are people here who are plant-based for a variety of reasons...but the point is that we don't eat meat. We don't talk about eating meat. And we, for sure, don't say that salmon lives don't matter as much as a cow, so you can eat them (a literal quote from that thread.)

These posts are quiet common, and are becoming more frequent. IMO we don't need to know how frequently (if ever) you eat meat. We don't need to know that you eat it once a week, once a month, or never. Were just here to share tips, recipes, and other advice for a plant-based diet. If you eat meat still, or your transitioning, I get it. Just maybe save those details for another thread, and be mindful of animal abuse concerns some people in this group have.

325,The Food Hierarchy: Where is Vegetarianism and its Many Types?,"Plenty of people tend to get vegetarian food confused with all other types of dietary restrictions, so I thought I'd do this, with a semi-rigorous mathematical treatment. 

First off, we have the **universal set, ξ** of **all food _typically_ consumed by people**. I'm certain I'll get pedants here talking about cannibalism and other extreme, exotic and highly hygienic varieties of consumables like Tide Pods, but here I am limiting food to a cultural majority. This, however, means things like insects and dog dicks (apparently a Chinese delicacy) are fair game in this set.

Then, we have three popular dietary restrictions as a result of religion: Kosher, Halal and Hindu food. Kosher and Halal food have much in common, such as the prohibition of pork, the handling of meat, et cetera. The list is too long to elaborate here, and I am neither Jewish nor Muslim, so I cannot claim to know the complete list of prohibited food items.

Hindu food is *almost always* devoid of beef (though, like everything else in Hinduism, there exists a sect that does their own thing). 

A **subset** of the set intersection of these three sets is **pescetarianism**: all plant-based food, dairy, eggs, and seafood is allowed. Personally I find this a rather odd distinction to make, but I suppose people who restrict themselves to these are likely allergic to poultry and bovine/porcine meat. 

Now, things get more complicated. 

We start with **ovo-lacto-vegetarianism** (I'm gonna use OLV, because it's a pain to re-type), which is the group that this subreddit is most familiar with, methinks. This is a subset of pescetarianism, and it means people eat eggs, dairy (of course, cheese *without* bovine rennet), plant material, and animal-derived plant material, like honey. Assuming ingredients are appropriately chosen and the food appropriately cooked, OLV food is a **strict** subset of **both** Kosher and Halal food—so if you have *never, ever* had meat or eggs in your household (like mine), the food you cook is A-OK to be served to Jews and Muslims (any Jews and Muslims here, please correct me on this if I'm wrong).

Then things move to **lacto-vegetarianism** (LV), also called Hindu vegetarianism. This is because nearly everyone who is vegetarian in the world lives in India, is Hindu, and is lacto-vegetarian. As the name suggests, this set here is excludes eggs, making it a strict subset of OLV. 

Beneath lacto-vegetarianism, things don't *immediately* get to veganism. Oh, no. Indian religions have a whole story planned for you. 

Jain food is a strict subset of LV food, and doesn't include vegetables of the genus *Allium* (read: onions, garlic, leeks, etc.). There are said to be multiple reasons for this, all typically stemming from Vedic interpretations of the effects of food on the body—apparently such vegetables are aphrodisiacs. Another oft-cited reason is that these are root vegetables (sometimes *other* root vegetables are disallowed, too, like potatoes, yams, carrots, etc), and harvesting them effectively kills the entire plant, thus violating the Hindu/Buddhist/Jain tenet of non-violence, or *ahimsa*. 

Buddhist vegetarians tend to follow this diet, too. Many Hindu vegetarians also adhere to this diet on certain holy days like Navaratri, the anniversary of a family member's passing, etc. Whether this entire *Allium*- and root-vegetable-avoiding idea was originally a Hindu one, or re-imported back from Jainism or Buddhism, is unclear. However, depending on the sect in question, dairy still tends to be allowed. 

Obviously, vegans can and do eat *Allium* vegetables, so Jain vegetarian food is not *really* a superset of **vegan** food, which everyone knows—*nothing*, not even the clothes on one's back, from animals or animal-derived effort, etc. So we have things like vegan cheese, Beyond, Impossible, Morningstar, there exist hundreds of Western brands of meat imitations catering to vegans (I personally hardly ever eat stuff like this, because who needs fake meat when you have Indian food? ^(just kidding please don't pitchfork me, I like fake meat too)). 

Beneath veganism there's fruitarianism, where people only eat the fruiting bodies of plants. Steve Jobs was purportedly on this diet. Sounds intense, and I doubt I could ever live like this (unless I was on a remote island).",vegetarian,delta_p_delta_x,1570695900,4,True,2019-10-10

I picked up some dried textured vegetable protein the other day. The recipe I want to make calls for a pound of ground beef. From what I've read, rehydrated tvp can be a 1:1 replacement but I can't tell how much dry that works out to be. I was hoping to put it straight into the spaghetti sauce so it rehydrated by soaking up the flavors in the sauce, rather then guessing, rehydrating, then just mixing it in after.

Also, the wikihow article I was looking at said to eat it promptly and discard leftovers but didn't give any explanation. Is it like, it will cause food poisoning really fast or the texture gets mushy or what?

We decided to try vegetarianism primarily for climate reasons, as we have a small child that we would like to contribute to the future for. Health benefits nonwithstanding.

I have done some research and for most things, I can just substitute a meal alternative, but they are VERY expensive where I live. A pound of meat substitute for chicken is almost three times the amount of what I am trying to avoid.

480,Hunting and environment,"Hello together,

First of all: I am no vegetarian and honestly, I am not planning to become one. I am thinking of eating less meat and perhaps only high-quality dairy products.
But there are a few topics about vegetarian lifestyle that go through my head, perhaps you can clarify a bit for me:

Hunting: if a vegetarian mainly wants to eat less meat to improve life for lifestock (cows and so on) he eats cheese and milk. He does not necessarily buy the products that care for the animals most. On the other hand, (at least here in Germany) there are meat products where you can be sure about this. Let’s say you buy deer meat from a hunter who only hunts to regulate the numbers and buy sausages from that meat as well. (The deer would have had a totally natural life until then) Would it not be technically better for the animals to leave away mass-produced milk and eat a deer steak every now and then (as flexitarian)?

Ecological topics: if you replace meat by soy and this soy is produced eg in Brazil , as far as I know, there is a high risk, that the transport produced a lot of CO2 and that the land is gained by destroying rain forest. Honest question: is this a conflict of interest or is this still a better CO2 deal than eating meat? 

Long topic short: wouldn’t it sometimes be better for the whole planet to compromise about meat and dairy products in order to find a good middle between not harming animals and producing less CO2? 
Is there a set of rules that fit into this thinking?

Thank you for your thoughts , I am honestly curious 😊",vegetarian,Django-UN,1571051131,11,True,2019-10-14

I keep retching as I try to scrub the counters of this sin. It's permeated my hands, no matter how many times I wash them I get a strong whiff of cat urine every time they come even remotely close to my nose. 

I can't believe tofu would do me this dirty after everything we have been through together. I feel like I can never confidently slice a block open again, I will live in fear that there is something as cursed as what I just experienced waiting under the surface.

485,Vegans who chastise &amp; disparage vegetarians are ignorant doing a disservice,"Hey guys! As a long-time vegetarian who is now been vegan for a while, I wanted to talk about how I have noticed that there are some people in the vegan community who chastise put down and even hate vegetarians. This way of thinking is so wrong. (If anyone cares to look , Anonymous for the voiceless posted yesterday on there Facebook that “vegetarians are meat eaters” I made a whole video (which I did not watch)about how bad vegetarians are and how meat eaters cause less harm. When I was a vegetarian I did not eat much eggs I had only made a quiche about three times over the course of five years. I would eat a muffin or a baked good that may contain eggs but either than that I did not like eggs. I would go to Pizza Hut and get a mushroom pizza I would go to Dunkin’ Donuts and have cream in my coffee and I would have regular ice cream (all things I also did when I ate meat) only time I would put cheese on my food would be when I would make Italian food and that would probably be about once a week. I was never a big cheese person and even when I ate meat I would always get a hamburger not a cheeseburger.  I would also eat regular candy bars but I would always prefer dark chocolate. I would eat a lot of tofu and a lot of my meals were accidentally vegan. I’d love Mock meat substitutes and ate/still eat lots of rice and pasta. 
According to them vegetarians eat eggs and cheese for most of their diet and they also eat seafood. I had to explain to them multiple times that fish is not vegetarian because fish including shellfish is definitely meat. Just because there are idiots calling them selves vegetarian when they eat fish DOES NOT MEAN IT’S VEGETARIAN. Also according to them most meat eaters eat mostly plant-based diet, but  will have a steak a few times a month. Notice this way of thinking on Reddit as well. I talk to them about why don’t you educate them about using baking substitute in place of eggs when you’re cooking or baking. And about the great variety and great taste of non-dairy milk these days. But no they just want to chastise and disparage people. Add to that that many people will become vegetarian and then go vegan but no they don’t care. They also don’t want to acknowledge that it’s harder to go vegan and that there’s a lot of trace amounts of dairy products in snack foods or every day items and it’s much harder to avoid days than to just stop eating meat.  Anyhow I think not eating meat is much better than the standard American diet.",vegetarian,PantherPower83,1571073707,1,True,2019-10-14

14,"Eating junk food, trying to change","Hi Guys,

I've been a vegetarian all my life, because since childhood I've hated everything about meat - how it looks, how to smells, how it tastes... (so I am a vegetarian for 30+ years...) And yeah, I also don't like eating animals.

But the problem is I eat too much junk food. I am very lazy and picky eater. The result is I am very obese.

There is probably no hope for me to change it, because I am not good at following plans and I don't enjoy cooking unlike most people.

But hey, maybe I can figure something out. So let me ask couple of questions here.

1) What do you buy when you're at the mall and you're hungry? I don't talk about raw materials you transform into a meal in your kitchen later. I am talking about situation when you can't cook, because you're on your way to work or school and so on. I have tendencies to buy some sweets and unhealthy things in these situations. I was trying to switch to fruits and such recently, but... I would like to make a list of ""I am busy"" foods, please! Anything that comes on your mind.

2) Milk - I hate the taste of milk. Is there something I can use instead? I've tried to search here and I have found you mentioned oat milk and soy milk. Can these be put on oatmeal and so on?

3) I also don't like yogurts. Is there some replacement for them? Or do they contain some important nutrients? Or was it bad I basically ... have never ever eaten them in my life?

4) Quarks - I am not sure if you know what are these. I was convinced it's worldwide known but when I googled it, it seems to be really central-europe's thingy. It's very often recommended for vegetarians, because it contains lots of proteins and so on. But it also has really really specific taste that is a pure nightmare to have in a mouth. Some people told me it works with a cocoa, but nah, it's still horrible taste for me.

Does anybody has some experience with this one thing and how to make it edible or how to replace with something similarly nutritious?

64,Anyone else here only eat meat if it is hunted?,"My goals for initially becoming ovo-lacto vegetarian were largely environmental. I had started to make the transition a few years ago by not eating lamb or veal and using all cruelty free cosmetics and cleaning products. I then moved on to taking out other meat products over time (i.e., Chorizo, then Gelatin, red meat, and then finally poultry). However, hunting season is approaching, and I’m considering eating meat only if it is hunted. Does anyone else do this? In addition to the environmental footprint of animal agriculture, I also am disgusted by slaughterhouses and the mass “processing” of these animals. I feel as though hunting would fit my ethical values more because my family hunts just enough for a nuclear family to eat (my family also does *not* hunt on big hunting ranches). Has anyone else lived this type of lifestyle? I’m also looking to eliminate dairy from my diet completely, and only getting eggs from my mom’s chicken coop.

A free chicken sandwich.  

I wasn't really upset over anything that happened, and I don't really care for Chick-fil-a anyway, so I just gave the coupon to my friend.  But man did I have a good laugh over it. So I was wondering if any other of you veggies had some funny or frustrating restaurant stories to share!

We go over there to eat about once or twice a month (it’s a really expensive place) and I actually hadn’t gone since becoming vegetarian about six months ago. When we finally went yesterday, my cousin (who is a waitress there) came to take our orders. I was feeling a bit nervous about going because I wasn’t really sure if they even had many vegetarian recipes. I asked her what the vegetarian options were, and I was really shocked when she actually started listing all the meals that were vegetarian or could be made vegetarian by changing up a few things. She ended up giving me about 20 options which was way more than what I was expecting (to be honest I was thinking that pasta and salads were going to be it). 

Anyway, I ended up order a “veggie platter” which was wild rice, an assortment of steamed and roasted veggies, and scalloped potatoes with an **amazing** mushroom sauce on the side. My order came with a soup entree and my cousin was even considerate enough to advise me not to get a soup since the broth could contain meat in it and she didn’t want to “throw off my vegetarianism”. 

I just wanted to share this because I thought it was a really professional way of going about the situation, and I know some (if not most) people have had some sort of bad or annoying experience when trying to order vegetarian at a restaurant.

Throughout my diet I felt like I was eating plentiful; I have at least two decent-sized meals a day with the occasional snack and I don't feel hungry too often.  Is my body just adjusting to the fact that I'm ~most likely~ consuming less calories (I used to eat meat with almost every meal)?

I'm honestly curious what the consensus here is. I know Reddit seems to love Steve Irwin and I have almost no problem with that, but as an older redditor who came of age in the 1990s when South Park and others would make fun of him, this reverence does seem a little cult-like (I'm not glad he's dead and I feel bad for his son and wife, but I do remember a time when we could talk about the guy like a regular human). 

Anyway, my position is, he didn't seem to add much to science or humanity's understanding of any animals. He DID seem to amass personal fame and wealth by exploiting and harassing harmful animals. This seems like a dick move to me, and I honestly can't see why he's so revered. 

Am I crazy? Did he contribute a lot to our understanding of snakes and crocodiles and things? (I'm not being facetious here; it's just I remember his animal planet show in the 1990s was mostly him poking at snakes or wrestling crocodiles and even then, before I was a vegetarian, I was confused at the purpose of the whole thing). In fact, it seems to me, one could make a good argument that Mr. Irwin inspired a bunch of fan boys who want to go fuck with/hunt/cage wild animals.

Finally, just so it's clear it's not personal from me, I'm also against zoos and other nature shows where humans just fuck with wild animals. 

My general position is, unless you are a legit scientist, leave wild animals alone if at all possible. Same with wild places; leave them alone, too.",vegetarian,pol_pots,1567565346,13,True,2019-09-03

As a life-long vegetarian, I've found this new/recent trend on ""plant-based meats"" a bit amusing. While I wholeheartedly support more people turning vegetarian or at least eating more vegetarian food - sometimes I don't get it.

When I'm looking for food, I look for vegetarian options because I can't really stand the idea of eating meat (as in me myself, it's fine if others do). So getting food that's ""as good as the original thing"" meat doesn't really turn me hungrier, it makes me feel a bit uneasy for eating meat, if that makes any sense? Maybe I'm overthinking it.

But I would much rather have 5x more vegetarian/vegan options in any menu, based around just tofu, or paneer, or other proteins for what they are rather than gmo products resembling something else. 

What are your thoughts on this - or do you actually prefer the notion of mock meats to get more people hopefully eating better?

214,friend didn't tell me homemade food had chicken in it,"So one of my closest friends moved away relatively recently. She came back in town and I went over to her mothers place to hangout and see her off before she left again. They're from Mexico and her mother mainly speaks Spanish. My best friend wanted to eat lunch at her house (her mother was making a Mexican meal) before she left and obviously since I'd been there for a few hours they wanted me to eat with them. My friend let her mother know I was a vegetarian, we had the whole talk with her mother that I don't eat any meat and yes that also means I don't eat chicken. Her mother let us know I could eat the mashed potatoes and veggies she had as left overs. So we're eating and my friend asks her mother in Spanish how she makes the mashed potatoes and I overhear (they don't think I know much Spanish, which I don't) that it was made with chicken broth. I asked my friend casually then if it was made with sour cream and she was like no, it's made with milk. Which was true, I overheard that it was made with milk and chicken; she just left out the fact that it was made with chicken too. 

I continued to eat and finished the meal because I felt like it would've been rude to stop eating the meal or to seem put off by it (because I'm sure this was just an honest mistake) and I didn't want to come off as rude to her culture. Also because her mother is going through financial troubles and I feel like it would be extremely rude to turn away food I had already started eating in that case as well. 

So now I'm a bit frustrated with my friend I guess. I'm frustrated that she didn't tell me in that moment when I'd asked what it was made with and I'm frustrated that she didn't at least tell me afterwards. And I don't know if that's fair of me to be frustrated. Because I'm assuming she didn't say anything at the time or after because she didn't want to upset me or offend me or was afraid of how I'd react and offending her mother? But then why not tell me afterwards? I've been a vegetarian for over 10 years at this point so when people aren't honest with me about something having meat in it it really bothers me. It feels like they don't respect my values at all when they can't even be honest with me about it. Or it feels like she doesn't trust me at all to handle the situation with grace by not telling me. So I'm frustrated. I'm doubly frustrated because just days prior we'd gotten into an argument and I told her I need her to tell me things. That stupid things aren't a big deal and I don't care but I need her to tell me things so I know what's going on (she does this to a lot of people and it blows up in her face sometimes and I guess it was just the first time she'd done it to me). So it feels like the same problem we just talked about in another manner if that makes sense. Where she just isn't quite as forthcoming and honest with shit as she should be. I don't know, if you consider me your best friend why aren't you just honest with me?

Ughhh sorry. What do you guys think? Am I being crazy? Am I being too entitled? Should I say something? Part of me feels like I shouldn't because she's moved away but we're close enough that we still talk almost every day. And this bothers me.

So last night we had a massive supply of mussels that didn't sell and were on the verge of going bad... so I caved. I made myself some sort of random pasta dish with them and all night I was on the fence about doing it or not and after the fact I feel so much guilt about it. It was an amazing meal but at the same time the meat added... basically nothing. Kinda reminded me why I went veg to begin with as I've totally learned just how little meat actually adds to a good dish...   


Just yeah?

I asked the people at the counter if the coupon also applied to Impossible Whoppers, and they said yes, though you have to pay the difference in the cost of a regular Whopper. In my area that's $1.

Factoring everything in, it was about a 40% savings in cost over getting an Impossible Whopper meal. So if you like the Impossible Whopper this is the cheapest way to get it from what I have seen so far. YMMV though. This is simply what the local Burger King's policy seems to be.

I’ve been eating chicken salad wraps, turkey and cheese wraps, and that’s about it.

333,[Vent/Rant] constantly mocked for being a vegetarian.,"I've been a vegetarian for 3 years, and for the most part I keep it to myself other than when I go out to get food with people because ill ask the waiter(ess) if they can remove the meat from the dish, or if they have any vegetarian options and I don't keep it to myself because I'm embarrassed but just because I don't feel the need to talk about it unless the subject comes up.

For the most part I don't care how other people feel about me being a vegetarian, I've heard it all before ""Well you're still killing plants"", ""Its pointless"", ""You can still be healthy while eating meat"", ""We're meant to eat meat"" yadah yadah yadah, but normally what shuts people up is when I say ""Its my life, why do you care so much?"" 

But what gets under my skin the most is all the stupid ass ""jokes"" and comments that I hear every single god damn day.  If I hear a joke every now and again, whatever but when I can't even sit down and just eat my food in peace without having some comment made at me that's when I get pissed off. 

For example, not too long ago for lunch I had brought rice and vegetables, in a jar. I don't remember the conversation exactly but it was something about his handwriting and how it was harder to read than someone else and his comment was ""Oh well all the vegetables you're eating is blurring your vision, that's why you cant tell you vegan"", not only that but constantly the people that i'm around always makes a comment about what i'm eating and say ""oh your nasty vegan food"" or ""oh well since you're a vegan you can only eat rocks, since you'll be killing the grass"" (when I've repeatedly clarified that i'm not vegan) or talk about how ""malnourished"".

Then repeatedly i'll ask for them to just knock it off and leave me alone about it, but they just insist on continuing it and its so frustrating and irritating. All I want is to sit down and eat in peace without being reminded every damn second that I don't eat meat. What also bothers me even more is that when they call me a vegan as an insult. It's just so childish and again their ""jokes"" aren't funny, and this has been going on for 2 years and i'm tired of it. In the past I've brought this up in a different subreddit on an account (that is now deleted, as well as the post) and people were siding with the people that always mock me for it saying that ""its their obligation to make fun of me because I don't eat meat"", and that I was the one for being childish because I was getting irritated about it, like c'mon for 2 years I've asked for this to stop but they don't care.

Also its not like I could completely get away from them either, they're my teammates so I see them practically everyday, and its the fact that its constant I hear this shit every single day and its annoying, now if it was like once every other week or once a month okay whatever but everyday it just gets so draining. Then on top of that the ""jokes"" aren't even funny they're just down right rude like the ones i mentioned earlier, now if it was jokes like ""oh instead of having beef with someone do you have beans with them?"" like okay ill admit that would probably get a chuckle out of me, but at this point that would probably irritate me.

I’m a vegetarian and have been since I was 13 (I’m in my 20’s). It’s a moral thing for me, and I’ve never intentionally eaten meat since I gave it up. I’ve been accidentally served meat at restaurants a couple times, but it wasn’t intentional and I always make myself throw up because I want to. I just can’t stand the thought of meat being in my body as it’s, like I said, a moral thing.

I’ve met many people at this point who call themselves “vegetarian, I only eat meat once a month” or “vegetarian, I only eat meat when I’m drunk LOL”. Does anyone else find this insanely offensive? Trust me I party and get drunk too but I don’t eat meat no matter how drunk I am because IM A VEGETARIAN! 

I can’t stand this. It’s insulting. And it’s stupid... a vegetarian by definition is someone who doesn’t eat meat. You factually ARE NOT vegetarian if you sometimes eat meat on purpose. It’s fair to say your diet is mostly plant based or something like that, but there’s no such thing as “mostly vegetarian”.

I was happily eating and to my dismay, looked down to see a piece of sausage on my fork from the rice and beans! I began to look through it and there were several more pieces. The rice and beans was so flavorful I couldn't even tell and I was chatting so at the restaurant that I wasn't paying much attention. I know this is my fault of course as I should have asked to 100% confirm that there was no meat in my sides. However I still feel quite down and it feels like I have to start over at day 1! :( Has this ever happened to anyone else?",vegetarian,Jkhunt1,1568395653,12,True,2019-09-13
376,Eating at a Seafood Restaurant while being vegetarian,"Hello all, looking to hear from your point of view..
Here is some background: I'm vegetarian who doesn't eat onion/garlic and nothing cross contaminated with meat. 
In a long distance relationship where I rarely get to hang out with bf but when we do he is accommodating to where I eat, he states he rarely gets to eat at places he likes when we are together so we eat at a couple same places.

This coming week when I hang out with him, his family insists on going to a seafood restaurant despite my bf trying to convince them to go elsewhere. I've called the restaurant and the only thing that seems to go with my diet are the vegetables. Aside from being not too comfortable eating around a bunch of crab legs and shrimp, there's nothing much to eat so I'll be staring at everyone's food. And it's going to cost a whopping $40 which my bf will most likely cover but it's a stack of money for vegetables. My bf may not want to go if I don't go but I want him to be with his family whom he hasn't seen in over a year. 

I've thought of many ways to go about this such as eating beforehand and having dessert, not going and finding an event to attend, etc.. I feel like Im thinking too much into it.

I decided 2 months ago that I would go vegetarian and have since been googling food and drink brands that I have previously enjoyed in order to see if they are vegetarian or not. Every time I use google to see if something is vegetarian all of the search results are article talking about whether or not that brand is vegan instead of what I actually searched for, I understand that if something is vegan that it is also vegetarian but what happens if something is not vegan? Then I don’t know if it is vegetarian or not. 

Does anyone have any handy lists or just some info to pass on about what popular brands are vegetarian? And what to avoid? The google search that let me to writing this was a search to see if monster energy pipeline punch is suitable or not. But I’d be interested in any sweet or chocolate brands, ice cream, drinks both soft and alcoholic or any other popular food or drink brand. I’m in the UK so would primarily be UK brands please thank you

Ps.. Sorry for that little rant at the start I just don’t understand why google is only giving me vegan results when I specifically search the word “vegetarian” plus I’m surprised by the about of brands that just don’t bother to state on their packaging if they are vegetarian or not.

I was the type of person that liked the idea of becoming vegetarian for ethical and environmental reasons but couldn’t succeed more than a day - I ate meat typically once or twice a day every day!  I also enjoyed eating meat and couldn’t imagine cutting out a steak or chicken wings. This past summer I had thought about not eating meat more and more. I have always loved animals but was able to be differentiate the meat I was eating from the animal I was seeing. One day I just couldn’t make that differentiation anymore and felt so guilty and horrified with the sensation of chewing meat. I decided to try to gradually cut back on meat and see how I felt, and then possibly stop eating it altogether. 

I thought that since I was so reliant on meat in my meals that it would be difficult to transition but it was so easy to cut back that after a three or four days of not eating meat or even wanting it, I felt like maybe I should just go as long as I could without eating it. After about two weeks it wasn’t about seeing how long I could go. It just felt like the lifestyle for me. 

I am feeling so great. Physically, I don’t feel sluggish after I eat like I need a nap. It’s easier to wake up in the morning. I have lost 7 lbs but feel like I’m eating more than ever. Mentally, I feel focused, less stressed and anxious, and generally more happy and positive. I like not feeling guilty when I eat. I like eating vegetables! I like feeling like my actions are having a positive impact on the environment (however small).

So my mother orders what she needs and then I give the front counter worker (an older woman) my order above: mashed potato bowl, but no chicken or gravy. Immediately her eyebrows go up. 
“So...you just want the mashed potatoes...and corn?”
“And cheese.” I add, with a smile (I’m used to the usual “why bother ordering something without meat that you still have to pay for?” look). The woman still has this confused/disbelieving look on her face and my mom immediately chipped in and said “she’s a vegetarian”. 

Instead of understanding, the woman looks from my mom, to me, back to my mom and goes, “Oh, and has she ALWAYS had the mental issues?” in a VERY serious voice. My smile immediately dropped from polite kindness to obviously insulted and not amused. The woman noticed after a few seconds and went “I’m just kidding, hon!” And went back to completing our transaction. While waiting for our food, I just kept glowering at this lady. All I know is this woman is pretty lucky that I don’t like making a scene and that she wasn’t wearing a name tag...great way to insult paying customers!!! 

What should it matter what I am ordering??

481,Help going mainly ‘vegetarian’ again?,"So a while back my husband and I went vegetarian cold turkey, as they say. It was for both health reasons and moral reasons. 

We were vegetarian for hmm 5-8 months. Then I got pregnant. And I needed to eat what I could tolerate and I needed protein. (Love tofu but wasn’t comfortable eating a lot of soy while pregnant).  my husband eventually joined me in meat again because I’m typically the one that makes our food and let’s be honest- we love turkey and chicken. We’d really like to go flexitarian (slightly controversial, I know). Our main goal is that it’s not out of the norm for us to go even a full week without meat. We currently eat meat almost daily, if not daily. 

I’ve been going through this sub and I’m sorry if I come off as lazy (a lot of the foods posted just don’t fit our tastes) but with a newborn and all that- I’m just wondering if people have some recipes off the top of their heads they’d like to suggest. Currently rocking my baby for his nap as I post this before I get ready to go to Trader Joe’s. 

Anyway- Now my baby is 2 months old so we’ve been eating meat for like 9 months now and we want to go back a bit.

Preferences

-We don’t eat seafoods but we do eat salmon 

-other fish only as sushi (pescatarian I know) 

-My husband prefers to not eat tofu, ever

-we don’t like eggplant, mushrooms, or sweet potatoes 

-we like to eat very healthy. While we do eat meat we also eat tons of veggies every single day, don’t typically cook with butter, we use seasoning instead of salt, etc. 

-we eat almost no fruit tbh. Is that important? I ate so much while pregnant due to cravings and now I’m just over it

-we honestly don’t really like meat substitutes 

I’m a great cook! So I can handle a lot of recipes. 

It’s hard to go back and rid of that mindset where meat is the main part of your dish. Any help is welcomed! Thank you for reading.",vegetarian,marriedtoaking,1568655048,32,True,2019-09-16

486,How can I convince my family to (at least) go flexitarian?,"Hi Everyone,

I'm seventeen, so I still live with my parents, and it is my job to cook dinner for them which I don't mind because I have a passion for it. I cook separate dinners, three meat-based meals that my family asks me to prepare and a plant-based meal for myself. I don't like touching the meat but I have to as I usually am requested to dry rub it, season it, the works. I've recently become interested in convincing my family in eating less meat as I converted for ethical reasons, but I am only now learning about the environmental and health factors.

Lately my dad has been showing interest in becoming a vegetarian. I made the entire family beyond meat burgers as a treat one night and my mom and dad loved them (my brother liked them until I told them they were beyond meat haha.) I do not cook them often as I do not agree with how much packaging they are in and how they aren't the best for you (but they're still really good.) My dad was surprised to hear how processed they were as well but I told him that a study from CBC found that they were about as bad for you as meat burgers and he was surprised. He recently told my mom he thinks that ""maybe one day in the future I'd like to go vegetarian"" which I'm super happy about for him, however he is still super interested in meat and I believe that he might prefer going flexitarian for a while. (flexitarians are people who eat meat less often)

My mom has a condition called lupus which causes flares of pain that can be worsened by high inflammatory foods such as meat (but not fish.) I've asked her before if she'd ever consider trying a vegetarian diet and she told me she had in the nineties but had stopped because he anemia was getting in the way. I wonder if she'd try going pescatarian or flexitarian as well? Much less inflammatory foods and she would be able to get protein from fish and veggies, nuts etc. I know she is reluctant and doesn't believe much in iron from plant based sources, as whenever I cook vegetarian for the entire family (which is about once every two months) she will sometimes ask me to add meat to her meals even though there is tofu, lentils, beans etc in her meal. 

My brother will not be on the same page however. He likes to lie and come up with sh\*t on the spot to try to ""convert me back"" such as telling me that produce grown without gmos is worse for the environment than meat, meat eaters are healthier and slimmer blah blah blah. He is a little overweight which is ironic, but I am sure he'd be impossible to try the flexitarian diet so I probably won't try lol.

Is there anyway I could maybe talk to my parents (politely) about it? Have you ever tried to convince your parents/relatives/friends to try something similar?",vegetarian,polipodo,1568664003,9,True,2019-09-16

489,[Serious] Genuine question for ethical vegetarians.,"This is a genuine question not meant to attack anyone in any way, I’m just curious to hear some different perspectives on the issue. For vegetarians who don’t eat meat for ethical and moral reasons (mainly that you don’t want to support the unnecessary killing of animals), what is stopping you from going vegan and cutting out all animal products? Based on what you know about the animal agriculture industry, how do you justify consuming these products? Again, I’m really not trying to stir the pot here, I’ve just never had the chance to speak to a vegetarian about it before, and I’d like to hear how you guys feel about it. No judgments here, just looking for a honest discussion.",vegetarian,Inspiredok,1568665934,1,True,2019-09-16

I’ve told him at least 5 times I don’t want it and he still continues. I don’t know how to get him to listen.,vegetarian,He11oK1tty,1568679816,7,True,2019-09-16
